  Error response when an unexpected error occurs on the server. This indicates a problem with Unkey's systems rather than your request.

  When you encounter this error:
  - The request ID in the response can help Unkey support investigate the issue
  - The error is likely temporary and retrying may succeed
  - If the error persists, contact Unkey support with the request ID
example:
  meta:
    requestId: req_8x5n2p9q1m4a7k3b
  error:
    title: Service Unavailable
    detail: The service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.
