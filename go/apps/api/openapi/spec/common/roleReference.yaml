      References an existing role by its database identifier.
      Use when you know the exact role ID and want to ensure you're referencing a specific role.
      Takes precedence over name when both are provided in the same object.
      Essential for automation scripts where role names might change but IDs remain stable.
    example: role_1234567890abcdef
  name:
    type: string
    minLength: 1
    maxLength: 100
    pattern: "^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$"

      Identifies the role by its human-readable name within the workspace.
      Role names must start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.
      Names must be unique within the workspace and are case-sensitive.
      More readable than IDs but vulnerable to integration breaks if roles are renamed.
      Use IDs for automation and names for human-configured integrations.
    example: admin
additionalProperties: false
example:
  id: role_1234567890abcdef
  name: admin
