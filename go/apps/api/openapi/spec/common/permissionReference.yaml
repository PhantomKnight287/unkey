      References an existing permission by its database identifier.
      Use when you know the exact permission ID and want to ensure you're referencing a specific permission.
      Takes precedence over name when both are provided in the same object.
      Essential for automation scripts where permission names might change but IDs remain stable.
    example: perm_1234567890abcdef

      Identifies the permission by slug for operations on the permission.
      Permission slugs use dot notation for hierarchical organization.
      Slugs must be unique within the workspace and are case-sensitive.
      More readable than IDs but vulnerable to integration breaks if permissions are renamed.
      Use IDs for automation and slugs for human-configured integrations.
    example: documents.write
additionalProperties: false
example:
  id: perm_1234567890abcdef
  slug: documents.write
