description: |-
  Complete list of all permissions directly assigned to the key after the removal operation (remaining permissions only).

  Notes:
  - This list does NOT include permissions granted through roles
  - For a complete permission picture, use `/v2/keys.getKey` instead
  - An empty array indicates the key has no direct permissions assigned
  - Any cached versions of the key are immediately invalidated to ensure consistency
  - Changes to permissions take effect within seconds for new verifications
example:
  - id: perm_1234567890abcdef
    name: documents.read
    slug: documents-read
  - id: perm_2345678901bcdefg
    name: documents.write
    slug: documents-write
