## What Happened?

This error occurs when you're trying to migrate api keys for a migration that doesn't exist in the Unkey system.

Common scenarios that trigger this error:

- Using an incorrect API ID in your requests
- Referencing an API that has been deleted
- Attempting to access an API in a workspace you don't have access to
- Typos in API names when using name-based lookups

Here's an example of a request that would trigger this error:

```bash
# Attempting to create a key for a non-existent API
curl -X POST https://api.unkey.com/v2/keys.migrateKeys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer unkey_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "apiId": "your_api_id",
    "migrationId": "nonexistent_migration_id",
    "keys": [{}]
  }'
```
