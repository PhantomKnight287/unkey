Informational [Page 3] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \n 1 . Introduction \nThis document provides the SCIM definitions, overview, concepts,\nflows, scenarios, and use cases. It also provides a list of the\nrequirements derived from the use cases.\nThe document's objective is to help with understanding of the design\nand applicability of the SCIM schema [ RFC7643 ] and SCIM protocol\n[ RFC7644 ].\nUnlike the practice of some protocols like Application Bridging for\nFederated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) and SAML2 WebSSO, SCIM provides\nprovisioning and de-provisioning of resources in a separate context\nfrom authentication (aka just-in-time provisioning).\n 1.1 . Terminology \nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [ RFC2119 ] when they\nappear in ALL CAPS. These words may also appear in this document in\nlowercase as plain English words, absent their normative meanings.\nHere is a list of acronyms and abbreviations used in this document:\no COI: Community of Interest\no CRM: Customer Relationship Management\no CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete\no CSP: Cloud Service Provider\no CSU: Cloud Service User\no ECS: Enterprise Cloud Subscriber\no IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service\no JIT: Just In Time\no PaaS: Platform as a Service\no SaaS: Software as a Service\no SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 4] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \no SCIM: System for Cross-domain Identity Management\no SSO: Single Sign-On\n 2 . SCIM User Scenarios \n 2.1 . Background and Context \nThe System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification\nis designed to manage user identity in cloud-based applications and\nservices in a standardized way to enable interoperability, security,\nand scalability. The specification suite seeks to build upon\nexperience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific\nemphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying\nexisting authentication, authorization, and privacy models. The\nintent of the SCIM specification is to reduce the cost and complexity\nof user management operations by providing a common user schema and\nextension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for\nexchanging this schema using standard protocols. In essence, make it\nfast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the\ncloud.\nThe SCIM scenarios are overviews of user stories designed to help\nclarify the intended scope of the SCIM effort.\n 2.2 . Model Concepts \n 2.2.1 . Triggers \nQuite simply, triggers are actions or activities that start SCIM\nflows. Triggers may not be relevant at the protocol level or the\nschema level; they really serve to help identify the type or activity\nthat resulted in a SCIM protocol exchange. Triggers make use of the\ntraditional provisioning CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)\noperations but add additional use-case contexts like SSO (Single-Sign\nOn) as it is designed to capture a class of use case that makes sense\nto the actor requesting it rather than to describe a protocol\noperation.\no Create SCIM Identity Resource - Service On-boarding Trigger: A\n\"create SCIM identity resource\" trigger is a service on-boarding\nactivity in which a business action such as a new hire or new\nservice subscription is initiated by one of the SCIM Actors. In\nthe protocol itself, service on-boarding may well be implemented\nvia the same resource PUT method as a service change. This is\nparticular to the implementation, and not to the use cases that\ndrive that implementation.\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 5] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \no Update SCIM Identity Resource - Service Change Trigger: An \"update\nSCIM identity resource\" trigger is a service change activity as a\nresult of an identity moving or changing its service level. An\n\"update SCIM identity\" trigger might be the result of a change in\na service subscription level or a change to key identity data used\nto denote a service subscription level. Password changes are\nspecifically called out from other more general identity attribute\nchanges as they are considered to have specific use-case\ndifferences.\no Delete SCIM Identity Resource - Service Termination Trigger: A\n\"delete SCIM identity resource\" trigger represents a specific and\ndeliberate action to remove an identity from a given SCIM service\npoint. At this stage, it is unclear if the SCIM protocol needs to\nidentify a separate protocol exchange for service suspension\nactions. This may be relevant as target services usually\ndifferentiate between these results and thus may require separate\nresource representations.\no Single Sign-On (SSO) Trigger - Service Access Request: A \"Single\nSign-On\" trigger is a special class of activity in which a Create\nor Update trigger is initiated during an SSO operational flow.\nThe implication here is that, as the result of a service access\nrequest by the end user (SSO), defined SCIM protocol exchanges can\nbe used to initiate SCIM resource CRUD operations somewhere in the\nservice cloud.\n 2.2.2 . Actors \nActors are the operating parties that take part in both sides of a\nSCIM protocol exchange and help identify the source of a given\nTrigger. So far, we have identified the following SCIM Actors:\no Cloud Service Provider (CSP): A CSP is the entity operating a\ngiven cloud service. In a SaaS scenario, this is simply the\napplication provider. In an IaaS or PaaS scenario, the CSP may be\nthe underlying IaaS/PaaS infrastructure provider or the owner of\nthe application running on that platform. In all cases, the CSP\nis the thing that holds the identity information being operated\nupon. Put another way, the CSP really is the service that the end\nuser interacts with.\no Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS): An ECS represents a middle tier\nof aggregation for related identity records. In one of our sample\nenterprise SaaS scenarios, the ECS is \"Example.com\" that\nsubscribes to a cloud-based CRM service \"SaaS-CRM Inc.\" (the CSP)\nfor all of its sales staff. The actual Cloud Service Users (CSUs)\nare the FooBar Inc. sales staff. The ECS Actor is identified to\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 6] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \nhelp capture use cases in which a single entity is given\nadministrative responsibility for other identity accounts. SCIM\nmay not address the configuration and setup of an ECS within the\nCSP, but it does address use cases in which SCIM identity\nresources are grouped together and administered as part of some\nbroader agreement or operational exchange.\no Cloud Service User (CSU): A CSU represents the real cloud service\nend user -- i.e., the person logging into and using the cloud\nservice. As described above, and ECS will typically own or manage\nmultiple CSU identities, whereas the CSU represents the FooBar\nInc. employee using the cloud service to manage their CRM process.\n+---------------------+\n| Cloud Service |\n| Provider (CSP) |\n+---------------------+\n|\n+--------------------------------+\n| |\nv v\n+----------------+ +----------------+\n|Enterprise Cloud| |Enterprise Cloud|\n|Subscriber (ECS)| |Subscriber (ECS)|\n+----------------+ +----------------+\n| |\n+----------------+ +----------------+\n| | | |\nv v v v\n+-------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+\n|Cloud Service| |Cloud Service| |Cloud Service| |Cloud Service|\n| User (CSU) | | User (CSU) | | User (CSU) | | User (CSU) |\n+-------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+\nFigure 1: SCIM Actors\n 2.2.3 . Modes and Flows \nModes identify the functional intent of a data flow initiated in a\nSCIM scenario. The modes identified so far are 'Push' and 'Pull'\nreferring to pushing data to and pulling data from an authoritative\nidentity data store.\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 7] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \nIn the SCIM scenarios, modes are often used in the context of a flow\nbetween two Actors. For example, one might refer to a Cloud-to-Cloud\nPull exchange. Here one Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is pulling\nidentity information from another CSP. Commonly referenced flows\nare:\no Cloud Service Provider to Cloud Service Provider (CSP-&gt;CSP)\no Enterprise Cloud Subscriber to Cloud Service Provider (ECS-&gt;CSP)\nModes and flows simply help us understand what is taking place; they\nare likely to be technically meaningless at the protocol level, but\nthey help the reader follow the SCIM scenarios and apply them to\nreal-world use cases.\n 2.2.4 . Bulk and Batch Operational Semantics \nIt is assumed that each of the trigger actions outlined in this\ndocument may be part of the larger bulk or batch operation.\nIndividual SCIM actions should be able to be collected together to\ncreate single protocol exchanges.\nThe initial focus of SCIM scenarios is on identifying base flows and\nsingle operations. The specific complexity of full bulk and batch\noperations is left to a later version of the scenarios or to the main\nspecification.\n 2.3 . Flows from Cloud Service Provider to Cloud Service Provider \n(CSP-&gt;CSP)\nThese scenarios represent flows between two Cloud Service Providers\n(CSPs). It is assumed that each CSP maintains an Identity Data Store\nfor its Cloud Service Users (CSUs). These scenarios address various\njoiner, mover, leaver, and JIT triggers, resulting in push and pull\ndata exchanges between the CSPs.\n 2.3.1 . CSP-&gt;CSP: Create Identity (Push) \nIn this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service\nagreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User\n(CSU) accounts. CSP-1 receives a Create Identity trigger action from\nits Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1). CSP-1 creates a local user\naccount for the new CSU. CSP-1 then pushes the new CSU joiner push\nrequest downstream to CSU-2 and gets confirmation that the account\nwas successfully created. After receiving the confirmation from CSP-\n2, CSP-1 sends an acknowledgment to the requesting ECS.\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 8] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \n 2.3.2 . CSP-&gt;CSP: Update Identity (Push) \nIn this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service\nagreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User\n(CSU) accounts. The Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) has already\ncreated an account with CSP-1 and supplied a critical attribute\n\"department\" that is used by CSP-1 to drive service options. CSP-1\nthen receives an Update Identity trigger action from its Enterprise\nCloud Subscriber (ECS). CSP-1 updates its local directory account\nwith the new department value. CSP-1 then initiates a separate SCIM\nprotocol exchange to push the mover change request downstream to CSP-\n2. After receiving the confirmation from CSP-2, CSP-1 sends an\nacknowledgment to ECS-1.\n 2.3.3 . CSP-&gt;CSP: Delete Identity (Push) \nIn this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service\nagreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User\n(CSU) accounts. CSP-1 receives a Delete Identity trigger action from\nits Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1). CSP-1 suspends the local\ndirectory account for the specified CSU account. CSP-1 then pushes a\ntermination request for the specified CSU account downstream to CSP-2\nand gets confirmation that the account was successfully removed.\nAfter receiving the confirmation from CSP-2, CSP-1 finalizes the\ndeletion operation and sends an acknowledgment to the requesting ECS.\nThis use case highlights how different CSPs may implement different\noperational semantics behind the same SCIM operation. Note CSP-1\nsuspends the account representation for its service, whereas CPS-2\nimplements a true delete operation.\n 2.3.4 . CSP-&gt;CSP: SSO Trigger (Push) \nIn this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service\nagreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User\n(CSU) accounts. However, rather than pre-provisioning accounts from\nCSP-1 to CSP-2, CSP-1 waits for a service access request from the end\nCloud Service User (CSU-1) before issuing account creation details to\nCSP-2. When the CSU completes a SSO transaction from CSP-1 to CSP-2,\nCSP-2 then creates an account for the CSU based on information pushed\nto it from CSP-1.\nAt the protocol level, this class of scenarios may result in the use\nof common protocol exchange patterns between CSP-1 and CSP-2.\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 9] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \n 2.3.5 . CSP-&gt;CSP: SSO Trigger (Pull) \nIn this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service\nagreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User\n(CSU) accounts. However, rather than pre-provisioning accounts from\nCSP-1 to CSP-2, CSP-2 waits for a service access request from the\nCloud Service User (CSU-1) before initiating a Pull request to gather\ninformation about the CSU sufficient to create a local account.\nAt the protocol level, this class of scenarios may result in the use\nof common protocol exchange patterns between CSP-2 and CSP-1.\n 2.3.6 . CSP-&gt;CSP: Password Reset (Push) \nIn this scenario, two CSPs (CSP-1 and CSP-2) have a shared service\nagreement in place that requires the exchange of Cloud Service User\n(CSU) accounts. CSP-1 wants to change the password for a specific\nCloud Service User (CSU-1). CSP-1 sends a request to CSP-2 to reset\nthe password value for CSU-1.\nAt the protocol level, this scenario may result in the same protocol\nexchange as any other attribute change request.\n 2.4 . Flows from Enterprise Cloud Subscriber to Cloud Service Provider \n(ECS-&gt;CSP)\nThese scenarios represent flows between an Enterprise Cloud\nSubscriber (ECS) and a Cloud Service Providers (CSP). It is assumed\nthat the ECS and the CSP each maintain an information access service\nfor the relevant Cloud Service Users (CSUs). These scenarios address\nvarious joiner, mover, leaver, and JIT triggers, resulting in push\nand pull data exchanges between the ECS and the CSP.\nMany of these scenarios are very similar to those defined in\n Section 2.3 . They are identified separately here so that we may\nexplore any differences that might emerge.\n 2.4.1 . ECS-&gt;CSP: Create Identity (Push) \nIn this scenario, an Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) maintains a\nservice with a Cloud Service Provider (CSP-1) that requires the\nsharing of various Cloud Service User (CSU) accounts. A new user\njoins ECS-1 and so ECS-1 pushes an account creation request to CSP-1,\nsupplying all required attribute values for the base SCIM schema and\nadditional values for the extended SCIM schema as required.\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 10] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \n 2.4.2 . ECS-&gt;CSP: Update Identity (Push) \nIn this scenario, an Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) maintains a\nservice with Cloud Service Provider (CSP-1) that drives service\ndefinition from a key account schema attribute called Department.\nECS-1 wishes to move a given CSU from Department A to Department B\nand so it pushes an attribute update request to the CSP.\n 2.4.3 . ECS-&gt;CSP: Delete Identity (Push) \nIn this scenario, an Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) maintains a\nservice with a Cloud Service Provider (CSP-1). Upon termination of\none of its employee's employment agreement, ECS-1 sends a suspend\naccount request to CSP-1. One week later, the ECS wishes to complete\nthe process by fully removing the Cloud Service User (CSU) account,\nso it sends a terminate account request to CSP-1.\n 2.4.4 . ECS-&gt;CSP: SSO Trigger (Pull) \nIn this scenario, an Enterprise Cloud Subscriber (ECS-1) maintains a\nservice with a Cloud Service Provider (CSP-1). No accounts are\ncreated or exchanged in advance. However, rather than pre-\nprovisioning accounts from ECS-1 to CSP-1, CSP-1 waits for a service\naccess request from the Cloud Service User (CSU-1) under the control\ndomain of ECS-1, before issuing an account Pull request to ECS-1.\n 3 . SCIM Use Cases \nThis section lists the SCIM use cases.\n 3.1 . Migration of the Identities \nDescription:\nA company SomeEnterprise runs an application ManageThem that relies\non the identity information about its employees (e.g., identifiers,\nattributes). The identity information is stored at the cloud\nprovided by SomeCSP. SomeEnterprise has decided to move identity\ninformation to the cloud of a different provider -- AnotherCSP. In\naddition, SomeEnterprise has purchased a second application\nManageThemMore, which also relies on the identity information.\nSomeEnterprise is able to move identity information to AnotherCSP\nwithout changing the format of identity information. The application\nManageThemMore is able to use the identity information.\nPre-conditions:\no SomeCSP is a cloud service provider for SomeEnterprise.\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 11] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \no SomeCSP has a known attribute name and value for the Enterprise\nused for managing and transferring data.\no AnotherCSP is a new cloud service provider for SomeEnterprise.\no All involved cloud service providers and applications support the\nsame standard specifying the format for and actions on the user\n(e.g., employee) identity information.\nPost-conditions:\no SomeEnterprise has moved its employees' identity information from\nSomeCSP to AnotherCSP without making any changes to representation\nof identity information.\no Application ManageThemMore is able to use the identity\ninformation.\nRequirements:\no SomeEnterprise, the applications ManageThem and ManageThemMore,\nand the providers SomeCSP and AnotherCSP support a common standard\nfor identity information, which specifies the following:\n* Format (or schema) for representing user identity information\n* Interfaces and protocol for managing user identity information\no Cloud providers shall be able to meet regulatory requirements when\nmigrating identity information between jurisdictional regions\n(e.g., countries and states may have differing regulations on\nprivacy).\no Cloud providers shall be able to log all actions related to\nSomeEnterprise employees' identities.\no The logs should be secure and available for auditing.\n 3.2 . Single Sign-On (SSO) Service \nDescription:\nBob has an account in an application hosted by a cloud service\nprovider SomeCSP. SomeCSP has federated its user identities with a\ncloud service provider AnotherCSP. Bob requests a service from an\napplication running on AnotherCSP. The application running on\nAnotherCSP, relying on Bob's authentication by SomeCSP and using\nidentity information provided by SomeCSP, serves Bob's request.\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 12] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \nPre-conditions:\no Bob's identity information is stored on SomeCSP.\no SomeCSP and AnotherCSP have established trust and federated their\nuser identities.\no SomeCSP is able to authenticate Bob.\no SomeCSP is able to securely provide the authentication results to\nAnotherCSP.\no SomeCSP is able to securely provide Bob's identity information\n(e.g., attributes) to AnotherCSP.\no AnotherCSP is able to verify information provided by SomeCSP.\no SomeCSP is able to process the identity information received from\nAnotherCSP.\nPost-conditions:\nBob has received the requested service from an application running on\nAnotherCSP without having to authenticate to that application\nexplicitly.\nRequirements:\no Bob must have an account with SomeCSP.\no SomeCSP and AnotherCSP must establish trust and federate their\nuser identities.\no SomeCSP must be able to authenticate Bob.\no SomeCSP must be able to securely provide the authentication\nresults to AnotherCSP.\no SomeCSP must be able to securely provide Bob's identity\ninformation (e.g., attributes) to AnotherCSP.\no AnotherCSP must be able to verify the identity information\nprovided by SomeCSP.\no SomeCSP must be able to process the identity information received\nfrom AnotherCSP.\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 13] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \no SomeCSP and AnotherCSP must log information generated by Bob's\nactions according to their policies and the trust agreement\nbetween them.\n 3.3 . Provisioning of the User Accounts for a Community of Interest \n(COI)\nDescription:\nOrganization YourHR provides Human Resources (HR) services to a\nCommunity of Interest (COI) YourCOI. The HR services are offered as\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) on public and private clouds. YourCOI's\noffices are located all over the world. Their Information Technology\n(IT) systems may be composed of combinations of the applications\nrunning on private and public clouds along with traditional IT\nsystems. The local YourCOI offices are responsible for collecting\npersonal information (i.e., user identities and attributes). YourHR\nservices provide means for provisioning and distributing the employee\nidentity information across all YourCOI offices. YourHR also enables\nindividual users (e.g., employees) to manage personal information\nthat they are responsible for (e.g., update of an address or a\ntelephone number).\nPre-conditions:\no YourCOI has a complex infrastructure composed of a large number of\nlocal offices that rely on diverse IT systems.\no YourCOI has contracted YourHR to provide the HR services.\no Each local office has a right to establish a personal account for\nan employee.\nPost-conditions:\no All personal accounts are globally available to any authorized\nuser or application across the YourCOI system through the services\nprovided by YourHR.\no The employees have the ability to manage the part of personal\ninformation that is their responsibility.\n LI, et al. Informational [Page 14] \n \n RFC 7642 SCIM Requirements September 2015 \nRequirements:\no YourHR must ensure that the local offices generate information\nthat is provisioned securely and consider privacy requirements in\na timely fashion across systems that may span technical (e.g.,\nprotocols and applications), administrative (e.g., corporate),\nregulatory (e.g., location), and jurisdictional domains.\no Management of personal information must be protected against\nunauthorized access and eavesdropping, and it should be\ndistributed only to authorized parties and services.\no Regulatory requirements shall be met when migrating identity\ninformation between jurisdictional regions (e.g., countries and\nstates may have differing regulations on privacy).\no All operations with identity data must be securely logged.\no The logs should be available for auditing.\n 3.4 . Transfer of Attributes to a Relying Party's Website \nDescription:\nAn end user has an account in a directory service A with one or more\nattributes.

Security Considerations \nAuthentication and authorization must be guaranteed for the SCIM\noperations to ensure that only authenticated entities can perform the\nSCIM requests and the requested SCIM operations are authorized.\nSCIM resources (e.g., Users and Groups) can contain sensitive\ninformation. Thus, data confidentiality MUST be guaranteed at the\ntransport layer.\n LI, et al.

Le Van Gong, Sun\nAbstract\nMuch work has been dedicated to authenticating clients to service providers, ranging\nfrom the use of client TLS in the Web to the development of Single Sign-On mechanisms\nto enable usable authentication in a circle of trust, as outlined in the Liberty Alliance ID\u0002FF [ID-FF] and SAML Single Sign-On profiles [SAML2]. What remains hard is the\neffective authentication of Service Providers to clients, due in part to client device\nlimitations, provisioning issues and user understanding and education. For these reasons\nPKI based solutions including the use of TLS server authentication, have not been\nparticularly effective, even though such processing has been developed for years.\nWe suggest two approaches. One is creating and re-using a shared client secret unique to\neach server to enable the client to authenticate the server (an approach we did not invent).\nThe second is what we call Simplified Server Authentication (SSA), an analog of SSO\nfor server authentication that can reuse many of those mechanisms and infrastructure and\nwhich can be integrated with shared client secrets. This approach is typically appropriate\nwithin a community of trust, such as a group of enterprise servers that have established\nrelationships with an identity provider.\nIntroduction\nThe need for server authentication is clear with the many risks associated with a client\naccessing a false site purporting to be a real site and sharing private information at that\nfalse site, be it passwords, financial information, or other private information leading to\nidentity theft and other losses of privacy.\nThe traditional approach has been to use SSL/TLS [TLS] that includes a PKI based\nmechanism for establishing the identity of the server. This relies upon the server\nsupporting SSL/TLS and being configured with a key pair and certificate suitable for\nTLS. If all goes well the client TLS software executes the TLS protocol, validates a\nsignature as part of that protocol and establishes that the server is as expected.\nThere are a few potential flaws with this approach:\n1. In addition to validating a signature, additional steps are required and not always\nperformed – steps to establish trust in the entire mechanism. These include\ncertificate path validation, leading to a trusted root authority and timely certificate\nstatus validation.\n2 of 4\n2. The browser needs to be configured with the correct root certificates and not with\ninappropriate certificates. Management of this configuration is beyond most users.\nA related concern is the use of self-signed certificates or sites that do not use\ncertificates issued by a commonly accepted certificate issuer.\n3. SSL/TLS checks that the domain name accessed matches information in the\ncertificate, but this does not prevent attacks against DNS in conjunction with the\nuse of inappropriate certificates.\n4. Export regulations and configuration can cause unexpectedly weak cryptography\nto be used.\n5. Finally the user has no idea how to confirm that the process is operating properly\nor what to do if a pop-up message occurs, other than to simply go on, regardless.\n6. The user must trust the entire infrastructure, including the browser security\nimplementation.\nThese concerns also exist if an alternative but similar approach is deployed, such as\nsigning metadata with an XML Signature and then providing that signature with the\nclient. Similar validation, trust and end-user issues remain, although use of services like\nXKMS [XKMS] can move some of the problems from the client.\nThere are two potential solutions that can be used in different circumstances.\nIn the case that a client establishes a long-standing relationship with relatively few sites,\nthe user can manage this with minimal cooperation of each site. By sharing a secret with\nthe site, and expecting the site to provide this information upon each access, a user can\nrecognize a false site by the fact that it is unable to provide this information. This\ninformation may be protected and provided in a variety of means discussed below.\nFor a more scalable solution within a community, SSO mechanisms may be re-used to\nprovide server authentication on behalf of the client. For example, when a client accesses\na service provider the initial request can be redirected to an identity provider that can\nperform authentication of the service provider before redirecting the client back to the it.\nIn this case it is reasonable to expect the identity provider to support a variety of\nmechanisms for server authentication and to be able to correctly perform PKI or other\nvalidation checks in conjunction with signature verification. This approach may be used\nto establish a shared client secret to simplify subsequent server authentication and access.\nShared Secret Approach\nThe use of shared secret requires a registration process at the server, where the user\nestablishes an “account” and provides a private piece of information (essentially a\npassword for the server to use to authenticate to the client). Many common web sites\nestablish accounts for a variety of reasons – buying (e.g. amazon.com), travel (e.g.\naa.com), online communities (to have a handle and maintain state) and so on, so this is an\nincremental change to the data maintained at the server.\n3 of 4\nThis does require a standard means for the server to present the password, both in format\nand protocol. The password also needs to be protected on the wire, in storage, and care\nmust be taken to prevent replay attacks. Thus one could expect an additional HTTP\nheader on the request containing a nonce, with an additional response header containing a\nHash of the nonce, password hash, and server domain name for example.\nThe browser must also be modified to generate the nonce and HTTP header on the\nrequest, and to recognize and process the response value. It is also necessary for the\nbrowser user to maintain a list of sites where such server authentication is required.\nModern browsers offer the possibility to develop relatively sophisticated plugins that\ncould provide such functionality.\nAlthough the simplified server authentication approach we described below offers more\nflexibility and a smaller impact on the browser we believe the shared secret approach is\nrelevant when 3rd party authentication is undesirable (or not possible).\nSimplified Server Authentication (SSA)\nMuch work has been done on simplifying and making client authentication to servers\nusable, especially when a client needs to access multiple service providers that share a\nbusiness relationship. Standards from the Liberty Alliance on the Identity Federation\nFramework (ID-FF) have addressed this problem, taking special care to address privacy\nrequirements based on laws, regulations and best practices. This work has also been\nstandardized and reflected in the latest OASIS SAML 2.0 single sign-on profile.\nA single sign-on approach like this makes use of the ability of Web servers to redirect\nbrowser requests, enabling a service provider to redirect a client request to an\ninfrastructure component, an Identity Provider, obtain authentication information for the\nuser based on a previous authentication act, or to require a new authentication interaction\nwith the client. Once all the necessary steps have been taken by the identity provider\n(IDP), the client is redirected back to the service provider and able to take advantage of\nthe service.\nThis approach allows authentication mechanisms to be implemented by an IDP,\nsimplifying service provider implementation, and most importantly avoids the need for\nthe client to establish passwords at multiple sites and to authenticate repeatedly to\nmultiple sites. This increases usability and reduces the risks associated with password re\u0002use and repeated authentication.\nThis concept, and in fact the infrastructure, may be also applied to server authentication\nto the client. In this case when a client accesses a service provider it may require that the\nservice provider authenticate to a trusted identity provider (not to the client) and that the\nresponse for the request come from the identity provider, containing an authentication\nassertion for that provider. This may be an XML Signature signed XML quantity for\nexample. In this case key management is simplified since there are many fewer trusted\nidentity providers. Once the authentication artifact is verified, the client can reconnect to\nthe IDP to be redirected to the correct service provider. Alternatively, the authentication\nprocess could have provided the SP with a shared secret that it can now present to the\nclient as mentioned in the shared secret approach, allowing a subsequent direct\n4 of 4\nconnection to the SP. In this case the client may rely upon the IDP and use a trusted\nSSL/TLS channel to obtain a server secret from the IDP to be used in subsequent\nauthentication. (In this case more care may be used in establishing and securing the use of\nSSL/TLS).\nIf the Identity Provider and the service provider had already been federated (around the\ncustomer's identity) then the same operation could lead to mutual (and seamless)\nauthentication between the service provider and the customer: the end-result of the\naforementioned sequence is that the user is directly logged in to his account at the service\nprovider.\nThis SSA approach will require the definition of some HTTP headers and other\nmechanisms similar to SSO approaches, and can re-use assertions such as SAML 2.0\nassertions, but much of the work may already have been done. We have not implemented\nthis, but are speculating that this is the case.\nThe Liberty Alliance and OASIS SSTC have also defined the concept of an “Enhanced\nClient or Proxy”, a component that is either integrated into a client (e.g. the browser) or\nthat exists as a proxy. This component knows how to reach an IDP on behalf of a client.\nA similar component could be defined that knows how to reach an IDP on behalf of a\nService Provider, and integrated as a server component or as part of a proxy. More\nthought on this is required, but we suggest that many of the mechanisms used for SSO\ncan be recast to approach the server problem.\nWe find the combination of a mechanism to establish and share a server password and\nthen subsequently use it particularly promising.\nReferences\n[ID-FF] Liberty Alliance Federation Framework ID-FF 1.1\nhttps://www.projectliberty.org/resources/specifications.php#box1\n[SAML2] Security Assertions Markup Language, OASIS\nhttp://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/security/#samlv20\n[SimplifiedClientAuth] see http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/05/31.html#a1241\n[TLS], RFC 2246, The TLS Protocol,\nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt\n[XKMS] XML Key Management, W3C\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/XKMS/",

            "text": "Modern-day security breaches like the SolarWinds or T-Mobile attacks are not one-off events; they are prime examples of how someone can steal your organization’s credentials and use them to gain illegitimate privileged access to sensitive assets. Data breaches happen daily , and in too many places at once to keep count. They remind us that, regardless of our information security investments, business-critical resources can be compromised if access is not protected. \n Organizations depend on a variety of systems, applications and devices to run their operations, and users require access to these resources to do their jobs efficiently. Managing this can be a challenge, especially in large corporations with hundreds or thousands of users requiring personalized access. Identity and access management adds a layer of security by tracking, managing and securing the identities of individuals and their associated data. It helps keep track of who is who, so that people can access the information they are authorized to see and make the transactions they are permitted to make. \n \n Table of contents \n Enable Javascript to view table \n \n What is identity management? \n Identity management is the process of managing user identities and access privileges in a centralized way. It involves recording and controlling identities within an organization and enforcing identity governance policies. Simply put, your online identity is the profile that identifies who you are when using a network, whereas your access refers to what permissions you have once you’re logged in. Together, they form an important part of how you interact with technology – it’s how computers know it’s really you attempting to log in instead of someone else. Identity management in action \n Through identity and access management (IAM), only specified users in an organization are allowed to access and handle sensitive information. Here are a few examples of identity management at work: \n \n Identity creation and maintenance : By creating automated workflows for scenarios like a new hire or a role transition, IAM centralizes the identity and access management life cycle of a company’s employees. This improves processing time for access and identity changes and reduces errors. \n Entitlement management : Life-cycle entitlements are assigned to individuals and their roles. For example, a production operator is able to view an online work procedure but may not be allowed to modify it. On the other hand, a supervisor will have the authority not only to view but to modify the file or create new ones. \n Identity proofing : Identity is at the core of a citizen’s everyday actions. Once the state has implemented a civil register, IAM enables governments to grant people the right to access their data (birth certificate, driver’s licence, etc.) and prove their identity. \n \n A number of identity and access management systems use role-based access control (RBAC). Under this approach, there are predefined job roles with specific sets of access privileges. For instance, if an HR employee is put in charge of training, it makes little sense to also give them access to pay role and salary files. There are many other forms of automatic access control that each come with a variety of features and technology. \n Sign up for email updates \n Register for additional resources and updates on IT and related technologies! \n Common features of identity management \n Many different forms of identity management software exist on the market and there is no official definition of what they must and must not include. However, a couple of essential features stand out: \n \n Single sign-on (SSO) : This is when users can access multiple applications and services from a single location, avoiding the need for different usernames and passwords. \n Two-factor authentication : This involves verifying someone’s identity not just with their username and password, but also with another piece of information like a PIN or a token. \n \n Other features of identity management may include automatic provisioning of user accounts, password management, workflow, and compliance and audit services. In recent years, a new generation of identity management technologies has emerged, which focuses on ease of use in addition to security . Some examples are biometric authentication (such as fingerprints or facial recognition), multi-factor authentication (requiring several verification factors), and identity federation, whereby the responsibility for an individual’s or entity’s authentication is delegated to a trusted external party. SSO is an important aspect of federated ID management. \n These key features of identity management are shared by nearly all of today’s identity management systems (IMS). An IMS is an online platform that helps organizations manage a range of identities in a secure and efficient manner. It integrates with various other systems within an organization, such as HR systems, e-commerce platforms and accounting software. How does identity management work? \n Broadly speaking, identity management systems perform three main tasks: identification , authentication and authorization . This enables the right people, depending on their job functions, to access the tools they need to perform their assigned duties – without granting them access to those they don’t need. \n Identity and access – what’s the difference? The terms “identity management” and “access management” are often used interchangeably, but they are two distinct concepts. The crucial difference is that identity management deals with user accounts (authentication) while access management deals with permissions and privileges (authorization). \n Let’s take an example. When a user enters their login credentials, their identity is being checked against a database to verify if the entered credentials match the ones stored in the database – this is authentication. Once the user’s identity has been established, they are then granted access to the resources their account is cleared for – that’s authorization. Identity management: what’s in it for you? \n An identity management system is a valuable tool for protecting the information and resources of organizations of any size. It allows you to securely store user data and manage user access privileges, providing a secure and reliable way to keep your operations running smoothly. \n The benefits of identity management include the following: \n \n Increased security : An IMS helps protect your organization from unauthorized access and theft of user data. \n Improved efficiency : With an IMS, you can efficiently manage user login procedures and track user activity across multiple platforms using a single set of credentials. \n Reduced processing time/cost : An IMS’s automated workflows allow you to easily manage and administer user accounts, saving time and money on administrative tasks. \n Enhanced compliance : With an IMS, you can easily ensure compliance with regulations and standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA (see below). \n Deploying an identity management system \n The implementation of a sound identity management solution does not guarantee complete security, but adopting the following principles can make you less vulnerable to breaches and attacks from malicious actors. Here are a few tips to consider: \n \n Implement strong authentication methods (such as multi-factor authentication) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. \n Regularly review access control policies to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information and resources. \n Monitor and audit access to sensitive information and resources to detect and prevent unauthorized access. \n Frequently update user accounts to ensure they remain relevant and accurate. \n Implement a password management solution to reduce the risk of password-related security incidents, such as password reuse or password theft. \n What it means for compliance \n If identity and access management processes are not effectively controlled, you may be in non-compliance with industry standards or government regulations. The world is moving towards stricter regulations and standards for identity management – such as the European GDPR (which requires explicit consent from users for data collection) and the NIST 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines in the US (a roadmap for IAM best practices). \n Several protocols exist to support strong IAM policies by securing data and ensuring its integrity during transfer . Generally known as “Authentication, Authorization, Accounting”, or AAA, these identity and access management protocols provide security standards to simplify access management, aid compliance and create a uniform system for managing interactions between users and systems. \n Although ISO compliance is not a legal requirement, ISO standards naturally align with the regulations of various sector. So complying with ISO/IEC 27001 for information security can prevent your organization from getting into legal trouble over crucial aspects of identity management. Based around segregation of duty and a “one user, one ID” policy, it demonstrates that your corporate information is appropriately controlled. ISO/IEC 27001 Information security management systems ISO/IEC 24760-1 IT security and privacy — A framework for identity management ISO/IEC 27018 Protection of personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors Towards advanced identity management \n Complex compliance and security requirements are putting organizations under pressure more than ever before to protect their information, and challenge conventional ways of managing users’ identities. Half a decade ago, passwords were as close as you would get to a digital identity. But modern approaches to authentication require more than just a password. The widespread adoption of cloud computing, whose scalability and flexibility make it an attractive proposition for most organizations, has placed a new layer of stress on information security. \n Today, passwordless logins using biometrics or multi-factor authentication provide an alternative to traditional authentication – but that’s not enough. When it comes to securing data in multi-cloud environments, IT professionals view encryption as a critical security control. Storing identities on a blockchain has emerged as a solution that can provide immutable records of a given system without a centralized authority to manage them. As we contemplate our IAM future, it may not be long before blockchain-based identity systems become the norm for keeping a user’s data safe and secure.",

            "text": "The audience for this post is people who are unfamiliar with how privacy concerns may impact federated identity. That likely includes people from one of two groups: 1) people who are interested in privacy, but are new to the concept of federated identity, or 2) people who are familiar with federated identity, but are unaware of the changes being made to browsers because of the privacy concerns. The goal of the post is to provide an introduction to federated identity and why it matters, what the privacy changes are and their potential impact, and then describe how FedID CG is working to preserve federated identity in light of the privacy-related changes. \n Federated Identity encompasses the technologies, standards, and use cases in which the user identification and user authentication services are separated from the service providing the resource a user is trying to access. The organizations providing the user identification/authentication services are generally referred to as Identity Providers, and the organizations that utilize their services are often referred to as Relying Parties. Federated identity makes it possible for a website, app, and/or API to outsource authentication to an external entity. In practice, users with an account with entity A can gain access to web apps B and C without having to create new usernames and passwords, if B and C outsource authentication. Sometimes referred to as Single Sign-On, or SSO, there is a distinction to be made between SSO and federated identity. SSO is a property of federated identity that makes it possible for a user to gain access to distinct web apps or API without having to reenter credentials. The broader use of federated identity is when the resources involved are located in different security domains and are owned by different organizations. \n The types of organizations that use federated identity are as varied as the internet. It’s a common practice to use federated identity to streamline account management and access by allowing users to log in with an identity provider account (those “Log in with Facebook”, “Log in with Google”, “Log in with …” buttons.). It’s also commonly used by businesses to manage their employees’ access to company resources. Universities use federated identity to offer students multi-institutional academic programs, to provide shared access to educational resources, and for research collaboration. Federal institutions use federated identity to manage access to federal resources too – as do financial institutions. And for one final example, it’s also frequently used in Software-as-a-Service business models as well. \n Federated identity significantly reduces the burden on users by limiting account proliferation. It streamlines the user experience, lowers the security risks associated with password re-use (e.g., credential stuffing attacks), decreases the raw number of access credentials that a user has to remember and manage, and facilitates inter-organizational relationships and management. \n However, linking a user’s identity across systems also raises privacy concerns, especially when done across organizations/entities (and to a much lesser extent even when the resources are all owned by the same organization). While the objective of federated identity systems is to facilitate a user’s access to resources online, it was originally designed on top of web primitives (e.g. third-party cookies, top-level navigations, etc). These primitives can and are being abused to track users without their consent or full understanding. \n In response to these concerns, user-agents are making changes to how they work with some of the fundamental primitives of the web to prevent the uncontrolled, hidden tracking of users. Since federated identity often utilizes these same primitives to exchange necessary information to complete authentication flows, we need to develop solutions that address these privacy concerns without breaking federated identity. \n There are a variety of privacy-related interventions that user-agents are exploring. These include deprecating third-party cookies, controlling access to the client’s web storage, removing certain parameters from links (often referred to as link decoration), and restricting the capabilities of navigational redirects. Federated identity often relies on these same mechanisms, and so the changes being made to improve support for end-user privacy are having an effect on federated identity systems. Since the most immediate change is the deprecation of third-party cookies (having already been deployed in Safari and Firefox, and publicly planned for Chrome in late 2023), the Federated Identity Community Group (FedID CG) is currently focusing most of its attention on the impact of that change. The group is working to preserve federation when third-party cookies are deprecated. \n The FedID CG meets every week to provide feedback on the proposals that are relevant to federated identity. The full charter for the group can be found here . If you’re interested in learning more, we are currently working on a draft report that will be published shortly. If you’d like to participate in the group, you can join FedID CG here . Please note that while a W3C account is required to join, you do not need to be a member of the W3C.

            "summary": "Single sign-on (SSO) is a feature of federated identity that allows users to access different web apps or APIs without re-entering credentials.  Federated identity, more broadly, separates user identification and authentication from the service being accessed, letting users log in with an existing account (like \"Log in with Google\") to access various resources.  While SSO streamlines access, it's important to note that federated identity's reliance on web primitives like cookies raises privacy concerns, leading to browser changes that impact how it functions.\n",

Besides\nproviding a friendly user experience, various SSO technologies\nprovide additional security characteristics for authentication to\nnetwork services in an enterprise. Several SSO technologies are in\ndeployment today, but unfortunately each of the technologies is\nimplemented by intrusively changing the client software used to\naccess the network service and in some cases the service itself.\nThe next section presents a brief overview of the most popular SSO\nmechanisms.\nA typical client workstation has several different implementations\nof a given application layer protocol from different vendors. For\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 2] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \nexample, there are often more than one web-browser software suite\ninstalled on a client workstation, and each of these suites\ngenerally have their own protocol stack for HTTP, FTP, LDAP, IMAP,\nPOP, NNTP, etc. In general, for many protocol stacks, there are\noften more than one application installed on the user's machine.\nIn an SSO environment, it should not matter which FTP client is\nused to access a particular FTP server in a security domain, as\nlong as the user is authenticated to the domain authentication\nserver. The user should be authenticated to the FTP server\ntransparently, i.e., without being prompted for password. The same\nholds true for other services such as World Wide Web (HTTP), news\n(NNTP), email (IMAP, POP), remote access (Telnet), print services\n(IPP), file services (NFS, WebDAV), directory services (LDAP),\netc. It is not practical to distribute a special SSO-enabled\nclient for each application protocol, which unfortunately, is the\ncurrent implementation approach for most SSO mechanisms, including\nKerberos, DCE, SSL, etc.\nThis document doesn't propose a new mechanism or API for SSO, but\nsuggests an implementation architecture that allows transparently\nenabling new and existing services for SSO. An ideal solution\nwould be to have each application vendor write to a common\nauthentication API such as GSSAPI or PAM APIs, and implement\nspecific modules for SSO using different heterogeneous\nauthentication technologies. In the absence of an industry wide\nconsensus on such a usage, this document presents alternative\narchitecture for implementing SSO that can co-exist with both SSO\naware and unaware applications.\n 6 Overview of SSO Mechanisms \n 6.1 Secret Credential Store \nThe simplest SSO technology entails securely storing user's\nauthentication credentials (such as private keys or passwords) for\ndifferent network services for each security domain, in a secure\ndatabase that is accessible to the user only after successful\nauthentication to the corresponding domain's authentication\nserver. When accessing a network service, the client software\nmakes invocations to a vendor provided library that securely\nretrieves the user's credentials from the secure database, using\nwhich, the client software then authenticates to the network\nservice. The vendor library provides additional interfaces to seed\nthe secret credential store with the user's credentials for each\nnetwork service for the first time. Synchronization of user's\ncredentials between the network service and secret credential\nstore is an issue with this approach, and the user is typically\nrequired to change it in both places. The advantage of this scheme\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 3] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \nis that it works with most services and requires no change to the\nserver component of the service.\n 6.2 Kerberos \nKerberos [3] is a network authentication protocol based on work by\nNeedham and Schroeder and developed originally at MIT. Kerberos\nprovides SSO to any network service that is kerberized and shares\na trust relation with the Kerberos authentication server, known as\nthe Ticket Granting Server (TGS). The user is required to\nauthenticate to TGS, which results in a Ticket Granting Ticket\n(TGT). The TGT serves as an authentication token that the client\nsoftware uses on user's behalf to obtain service tickets from the\nTGS. The service ticket identifies and authenticates the user to\nthe network service. Kerberos provides many other security\nservices including message protection (integrity,\nconfidentiality), delegation of credentials, single-point user\naccount management for various network services, etc. Kerberos\ndeployment, however, requires both the network client and server\nsoftware to make function invocations into a vendor provided\nKerberos library. This requires code changes to existing software\nand has impeded its mass deployment.\n 6.3 NetWare Authentication \nNetWare authentication (version 4 and beyond) is tightly\nintegrated with Novell Directory Service (NDS), which acts as the\nauthentication server. First, the NetWare client authenticates to\na particular NDS tree based on the user's password using a\nchallenge-response technique. Upon successful authentication, the\nclient retrieves the user's RSA private key from NDS, which is\nthen used to construct a short-term credential consisting of a\nGillou-Quisquater (GQ) key pair. The GQ key pair acts like an\nephemeral SSO credential (much like the TGT in Kerberos), and is\nused to subsequently authenticate to various servers that are part\nof the same NDS tree. The GQ key-pair is managed on the user's\nbehalf by the NetWare client library, which exposes specialized\nAPIs for application developers to write to, in order to make use\nof the SSO credentials to access NetWare servers.\n 6.4 DCE Security \nDCE stands for Distributed Computing Environment. It is an OSF\n(Open Software Foundation) product and is conceptually similar to\nKerberos. It even uses Kerberos V5 as one of its components. DCE\ndeployment also requires both the network client and server\nsoftware to make function invocations into a vendor provided DCE\nsecurity library.\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 4] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \n 6.5 X509 Authentication Framework \nIn its simplest form, the user unlocks his or her private key from\na secure storage on the local machine and the authentication\nlibrary uses the private key to sign an authentication token. The\nsigned authentication token is sent to the server along with the\nclient certificate (and optionally a chain of CA certificates) as\npart of authentication exchange. The server uses the client\ncertificate to validate the authenticator and the chain of CA\ncertificates to validate the client certificate. It then maps the\nclient certificate to a valid user in the system. The client\napplication is often written to an authentication library, which\nmanages user's private key in coordination with the application.\nSome authentication libraries support smart-card support to avoid\nstoring user's private key locally on disk. Other variants store\nthe private key on a secure server and use a challenge-response\nauthenticated mechanism based on a password to securely retrieve\nthe private key from the server. SSL/TLS use X509 Certificate\nbased authentication.\n 6.6 Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) \nPAM provides standard authentication APIs that applications need\nto write to in order that different authentication modules\n(including Kerberos, DCE, NetWare, X509, etc.) can be\ntransparently integrated to provide SSO.\n 7 Architecture Overview \nThis document presents a high level view of the implementation\narchitecture.\nIn order for various independently developed application protocol\nstacks to share a common security session, the security session\nshould be built at a layer lower than the application layer in the\nOSI protocol stack. TLS and IPSec follow the same principle, but\nthey are different in important ways. IPSec provides a node-to-\nnode level authentication (and message protection) but it doesn't\nhave a user context associated with it. TLS can be used for user\nauthentication and SSO, but it cannot associate a user context\nwithout the active participation of the application itself. This\nrequires the application to be written to the TLS APIs. Besides,\nit is just one of the numerous SSO mechanisms and it doesn't\ninteroperate with non-TLS servers, such as those that use DCE,\nOTP, or plain-text passwords for authentication.\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 5] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \nThe goal of this architecture is to transparently enable SSO for\nservices without changing the services themselves including a\nsupport for various combinations of authentication mechanisms.\nThe shared security layer is built between the transport layer and\nthe application layer by either replacing the implementation of\ntransport interface (BSD Sockets, WinSock, TLI or equivalent) on\nthe host operating system, or plugging-in a transport provider, if\nthe host operating system allows it, e.g., Winsock layered service\nprovider for Microsoft Windows suite of Operating Systems. The\noriginal APIs are preserved, so that applications using it are not\naffected beyond loading a different library. We shall refer to the\nnew transport layer implementation as the SSO enabled Transport\nInterface (SSOTI). In addition to SSOTI, a Protocol Interceptor\nModule (PIM) is implemented for each of the application layer\nprotocols such as FTP, HTTP, NNTP, IMAP, POP, LDAP, etc. The PIM\nfor a given protocol intercepts the client-server exchanges for\nthat protocol (based on configured host and port numbers) and\ninjects authentication and security layer information at\nappropriate time during the protocol. This allows authentication\nand other security (message protection) semantics to be preserved\nfor each application protocol. In addition, the user context\ninformation is also available to the PIM since the application\npasses it along during an authentication attempt. A security\npolicy database (SPD) is consulted to lookup the host and port for\nwhich SSO is to be enabled, the SSO mechanism to be used and other\nconfiguration parameters specific to the SSO mechanism. The\ninitial authentication to the authentication server for each\nsecurity domain is carried out during the user login sequence to\nthe workstation by integrating with the host operating system via\nPAM for Solaris, GINA for Windows NT and Windows 2000, etc.\nAlternatively, the SSOTI layer can initiate \"late\" authentication\nto the domain authentication server, during an authentication\nattempt for a given application within the domain. The security\npolicy database is retrieved from a secure server using a standard\nprotocol (such as LDAP) after server authentication.\nThe following figure illustrates a typical architecture for\nimplementing SSO where the application makes explicit calls into a\nvendor specific SSO library. Each application protocol may\npotentially have a different library to call into, and they are\nall independent of each other. Most SSO mechanisms including TLS,\nKerberos, DCE and NetWare Authentication use this model.\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 6] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \n+-----------------------------------+\n| Application Protocol Stack |\n| (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, etc.) |\n+----------------+-----------+------+\n| |\n| +-------+--------------+\n| | SSO Mechanism Layer |\n| +-------+--------------+\n| |\n+---------------+-----------+-----+\n| Transport Interface |\n|(BSD Sockets, Winsock, TLI, etc.)|\n+---------------+-----------------+\n|\n+--------+--------+\n| Transport Layer |\n| (TCP, UDP) |\n+--------+--------+\n|\n+-------+-------+\n| Network Layer |\n| (IP, IPX) |\n+---------------+\nThe proposed architecture uses protocol interceptor modules and\nvarious SSO mechanism modules underneath the transport interface.\nA security policy database is used to map the application protocol\nto the SSO mechanism based on configurable selectors, such as\nhostname, port number, user identity, etc.\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 7] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \n+-----------------------------------+ +--------------+\n| Application Protocol Stack | | Initial |\n| (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, etc.) | |Authentication+-+\n| | | Module | |\n+----------------+------------------+ +------+-------+ |\n| | |\n+---------------+-----------------+ | |\n| SSO Enabled Transport Interface | | |\n|(BSD Sockets, Winsock, TLI, etc.)+-----+ | |\n+---------------+-----------------+ | | |\n| | | |\n+---------------+--------------+ +----+---+------+ |\n|Protocol Interceptor Modules | |Security Policy| |\n| (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, etc.) +---+ Database | |\n| | +---------------+ |\n+---------------+---------+----+ +---------+\n| | |\n| +------+-----------------+---------+\n| |Single Sign-On Mechanism Layer |\n| |(Secret Credential Store, Kerberos|\n| | TLS, DCE, etc.) |\n| +--+-------------------------------+\n| |\n+--------+-----+--+\n| Transport Layer |\n| (TCP, UDP) |\n+--------+--------+\n|\n+-------+-------+\n| Network Layer |\n| (IP, IPX) |\n+---------------+\n 8 SSO Enabled Transport Interface (SSOTI) \nThe SSOTI is an implementation of the usual transport interface\n(BSD Sockets, Winsock, TLI, IPX Socket, etc.) that redirects all\ntraffic meant for a certain set of host, port and possibly other\nselectors, to a PIM as specified by the SPD. For example, all\ntraffic to hosts in a given subnet on port 143 can be redirected\nto an IMAP PIM, and all traffic on port 21 can be redirected to an\nFTP PIM. This is transparent to the application on both the client\nand the server side. The SPD may indicate that traffic to certain\nhosts or ports should be bypassed from any PIM. This is important\nif the application uses its own security module such as SSL or\nKerberos. In some cases, like HTTP over SSL or LDAP over SSL, the\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 8] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \napplication uses different ports for secure and insecure\ncommunication, which makes it easier to differentiate such\ntraffic. The use of security modules directly by the application\nmay not take advantage of the SSO capability provided by the\nSSOTI, since the security session is not shared. For instance, the\nuser's private key to be used for SSL client authentication may\nnot be accessible to the application, if the SSO Mechanism Layer\nobtained the user's private key securely from an authentication\nserver during the initial user login sequence. Such situations can\nbe managed by tricking the client application to think that it is\ncommunicating over an insecure port, and transparently provide\nsecurity below the SSOTI layer.\n 9 Protocol Interceptor Module (PIM) \nA PIM is written for each application protocol and allows\ncustomized handling of the protocol's authentication and security\nrequirements. For example, an IMAP PIM observes the IMAP exchanges\nbetween the client and the server and maintains the client\nauthentication state. Any simple authentication attempt by the\nclient is intercepted and replaced with a policy configured\nauthentication protocol. If the SPD indicates that Kerberos V5\nshould be used for authentication as well as message integrity\nprotection, the IMAP PIM calls into the Kerberos library and\nrequests a ticket to the IMAP server. Assuming that the client was\nauthenticated to the Kerberos Authentication Server (the Ticket\nGranting Server) during initial login, a service ticket to the\nIMAP server is obtained from the TGS and used for authentication.\nAll future IMAP messages sent by the client application are\nintegrity protected by the IMAP PIM before sending if off. On the\nserver side, if the IMAP server is kerberized, the IMAP PIM is\nbypassed, so that the client IMAP PIM interacts directly with the\nkerberized IMAP server. If the IMAP server was setup to use\nusername and password for authentication, as indicated by the SPD,\nthe client IMAP PIM would retrieve user's username and password\nfrom a configured Secure Credential Store, and include them as\npart of the Kerberos Authenticator. The IMAP PIM on the server\nside would verify the Kerberos Authenticator, extract the username\nand password from the authenticator, and pass it up to the IMAP\nserver. The IMAP server would use the username-password for\nauthentication, without even being aware of Kerberos happening\nunderneath.\nThe PIM approach requires that only one custom module be written\nfor each application protocol to SSO enable all applications using\nthat particular protocol. A PIM for FTP, SSO enables all the\nvarious FTP clients on the machine in a transparent manner. Some\napplication clients may prompt the user for username and password,\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 9] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \neven before passing it down to the transport layer. While this is\nunnecessary in our model, it doesn't hurt. Even if the user\nentered an incorrect password or simply skipped the prompt, a\npolicy-configured SSO would automatically be done by the PIM.\n 10 Security Policy Database (SPD) \nThe Security Policy Database controls configuration information\nvital for deciding if a particular communication channel should be\nintercepted or bypassed. It indicates the security domain to which\na particular host belongs, and the mapping between ports and\napplication protocols. The SPD may contain policy rules that\nindicate a set of selectors for deciding the security\ncharacteristics to be applied to a particular connection. The\nsecurity characteristics may include the SSO mechanism to be used,\nassociated security parameters such as message protection\npreference, security protocol specific settings, etc. The current\narchitecture makes no assumption about the representation of the\npolicy rules or their description language. It is desirable to\nmaintain such security policies centrally for ease of management,\nand have the client retrieve the policy from a secure server\nduring client initialization. The policy server MUST be\nauthenticated before downloading the policy. Client\nimplementations MAY poll the policy server for periodic policy\nupdates. Although LDAP is a reasonable choice for hosting such\npolicy information, the architecture doesn't mandate it. The\ndetails of policy database are beyond the scope of current\ndiscussion. There are several internet-drafts including [4], [5]\nand [6] that discuss various policy constructs, description\nlanguage and schema.\n 11 Single Sign-On Mechanism Layer \nThis layer may consist of as many authentication mechanisms as\ndesired. A GSSAPI based interface may be well suited to implement\nvarious authentication mechanisms, including vendor specific\nmechanisms for SSO. The SPD indicates which SSO mechanism should\nbe used when communicating with a particular service on a\nparticular host. The user's authentication credentials for various\nmechanisms in different security domains are maintained at this\nlayer. This might include the Kerberos credential cache, User's\nprivate key for Certificate based authentication, etc. This layer\nallows creating cross-technology authentication bridges, such as\nmapping a Kerberos principal to an X509 certificate and\ncorresponding private key stored in a secure credential store, and\nusing the certificate for transparent SSL client authentication.\nThe initial authentication to the domain authentication server\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 10] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \nshould be carried out during user login to the system, although\n\"late\" authentication can be carried out on demand as well. For\nexample, if the user chooses to skip authentication to a certain\nsecurity domain during initial system login, any attempt to access\na service within that security domain should require the user to\nsupply the authentication credentials. These credentials can then\nbe used to authenticate to the domain authentication server first,\nand then retrieve SSO credentials required for authenticating to\nthe required service.\nThe discussion so far assumes a single user environment, which is\ntrue for most workstation scenarios. In a single user environment,\nit is easy to associate the user context with any network request.\nMulti-user environments have always posed a challenging\nrequirement on lower layer security implementations such as TLS or\nIPSec, since the user context is not available to them. This is\nwhere the PIM approach has an advantage over others. Application\nprotocols usually send across the user identification information\nin some form. For example, FTP sends a command that looks like\n'USER vgoenka', LDAP sends the DN of the object to bind as, IMAP\ndefault authentication sends the username and password in the\nclear in a command that looks like 'a001 LOGIN vgoenka password',\nand so on. The user context is passed along by the application\nduring an authentication attempt. By intercepting the default\nauthentication attempt by the application, the PIM can get useful\nuser context information, so that multiple user security contexts\ncan be maintained in the security layer. The SPD can be modifiable\nby the user to associate multiple user ids with the same network\nprincipal, if the same user has different identities on different\nnetwork services.\n 12 Security Considerations \nThe SSO mechanisms used in the SSO mechanism layer may each have\nsecurity issues, which are beyond the scope of this document.\nThe security policy database forms a key security component in\nthis architecture, and should be stored at a secure central\nlocation for ease of management. Each client and server in the\nsecurity domain should authenticate the SPD server before\ndownloading the SPD. SPDs can be hosted on LDAP servers and\naccessed over SSL/TLS. This requires additional management of\ntrusted root certificates that the client and server machines\nshould be configured with, in order to authenticate the SPD\nserver.\nTransparent access to user's SSO credentials also implies that\nmalicious software (e.g., viruses) executing on the user's behalf\n Goenka Experimental - Expires September 2000 [Page 11] \n \n Network Single Sign-On Architecture March 2000 \ncan easily access all user's resources on the network. Although\nthis makes it slightly easier for system crackers to write such\nmalicious code, it doesn't introduce any additional security\nweakness that does not exist in the currently deployed SSO\nsolutions. However, by concentrating all the SSO mechanisms at a\ncommon layer, this architecture allows for better security\nvigilance and policy enforcement. For example, to allow detection\nof security compromise attempts, the SSOTI implementations MAY\nallow querying for the existing security associations and\nconfiguration of security audit logs. User level tools can then be\ninvoked to monitor the usage of various SSO-enabled network\nservices.\n 13 Conclusion \nThis document illustrates that popular SSO implementations require\napplications to be written to a vendor or mechanism specific API,\nwhich makes it difficult to enable many applications for SSO. An\narchitecture that can transparently enable applications for SSO\nand also make it possible to provide cross-technology SSO bridges\nis then presented as a solution.\n 14 Future Considerations \nIt is hoped that the architecture will be refined as it is\nreviewed by members of the Internet community, and will lead to a\nconsistent framework for development of network single sign-on\nacross different OS platforms.\n 15 References \n1 Bradner, S., \"The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3\",\n BCP 9 , RFC 2026 , October 1996.\n2 Bradner, S., \"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement\nLevels\", BCP 14 , RFC 2119 , March 1997\n3 John Kohl and B.

            "summary": "This 2000 Internet-Draft proposes an architecture for Network Single Sign-On (SSO) to address the lack of industry-wide standards for SSO APIs.  The architecture aims to enable applications for SSO transparently and allow different SSO solutions (like Kerberos, NetWare Authentication, DCE Security, X509, and PAM) to interoperate easily.  The key components are an SSO-enabled transport interface and a Protocol Interceptor Module (PIM).\n",

Introduction \nThe Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0\n[ OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os ] is an XML-based framework that allows\nidentity and security information to be shared across security\ndomains. The SAML specification, while primarily targeted at\nproviding cross domain Web browser single sign-on (SSO), was also\ndesigned to be modular and extensible to facilitate use in other\ncontexts.\nThe Assertion, an XML security token, is a fundamental construct of\nSAML that is often adopted for use in other protocols and\nspecifications. (Some examples include [ OASIS.WSS-SAMLTokenProfile ]\nand [ OASIS.WS-Fed ].) An Assertion is generally issued by an Identity\nProvider and consumed by a Service Provider that relies on its\ncontent to identify the Assertion's subject for security-related\npurposes.\nThe OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [ RFC6749 ] provides a method for\nmaking authenticated HTTP requests to a resource using an access\ntoken. Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an\nauthorization server (AS) with the (sometimes implicit) approval of\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 2] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \nthe resource owner. In OAuth, an authorization grant is an abstract\nterm used to describe intermediate credentials that represent the\nresource owner authorization. An authorization grant is used by the\nclient to obtain an access token. Several authorization grant types\nare defined to support a wide range of client types and user\nexperiences. OAuth also allows for the definition of new extension\ngrant types to support additional clients or to provide a bridge\nbetween OAuth and other trust frameworks. Finally, OAuth allows the\ndefinition of additional authentication mechanisms to be used by\nclients when interacting with the authorization server.\n\"Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and\nAuthorization Grants\" [ RFC7521 ] is an abstract extension to OAuth 2.0\nthat provides a general framework for the use of assertions as client\ncredentials and/or authorization grants with OAuth 2.0. This\nspecification profiles the OAuth Assertion Framework [ RFC7521 ] to\ndefine an extension grant type that uses a SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion\nto request an OAuth 2.0 access token as well as for use as client\ncredentials. The format and processing rules for the SAML Assertion\ndefined in this specification are intentionally similar, though not\nidentical, to those in the Web Browser SSO profile defined in the\nSAML Profiles [ OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os ] specification. This\nspecification is reusing, to the extent reasonable, concepts and\npatterns from that well-established profile.\nThis document defines how a SAML Assertion can be used to request an\naccess token when a client wishes to utilize an existing trust\nrelationship, expressed through the semantics of the SAML Assertion,\nwithout a direct user approval step at the authorization server. It\nalso defines how a SAML Assertion can be used as a client\nauthentication mechanism. The use of an Assertion for client\nauthentication is orthogonal to and separable from using an Assertion\nas an authorization grant. They can be used either in combination or\nseparately. Client assertion authentication is nothing more than an\nalternative way for a client to authenticate to the token endpoint,\nand it must be used in conjunction with some grant type to form a\ncomplete and meaningful protocol request. Assertion authorization\ngrants may be used with or without client authentication or\nidentification. Whether or not client authentication is needed in\nconjunction with an assertion authorization grant, as well as the\nsupported types of client authentication, are policy decisions at the\ndiscretion of the authorization server.\nThe process by which the client obtains the SAML Assertion, prior to\nexchanging it with the authorization server or using it for client\nauthentication, is out of scope.\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 3] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \n 1.1 . Notational Conventions \nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [ RFC2119 ].\nUnless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values\nare case sensitive.\n 1.2 . Terminology \nAll terms are as defined in the following specifications: \"The OAuth\n2.0 Authorization Framework\" [ RFC6749 ], the OAuth Assertion Framework\n[ RFC7521 ], and \"Assertions and Protocols for the OASIS Security\nAssertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0\" [ OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os ].\n 2 . HTTP Parameter Bindings for Transporting Assertions \nThe OAuth Assertion Framework [ RFC7521 ] defines generic HTTP\nparameters for transporting assertions during interactions with a\ntoken endpoint. This section defines specific parameters and\ntreatments of those parameters for use with SAML 2.0 Bearer\nAssertions.\n 2.1 . Using SAML Assertions as Authorization Grants \nTo use a SAML Bearer Assertion as an authorization grant, the client\nuses an access token request as defined in Section 4 of the OAuth\nAssertion Framework [ RFC7521 ] with the following specific parameter\nvalues and encodings.\nThe value of the \"grant_type\" parameter is\n\"urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer\".\nThe value of the \"assertion\" parameter contains a single SAML 2.0\nAssertion. It MUST NOT contain more than one SAML 2.0 Assertion.\nThe SAML Assertion XML data MUST be encoded using base64url, where\nthe encoding adheres to the definition in Section 5 of RFC 4648 \n[ RFC4648 ] and where the padding bits are set to zero. To avoid the\nneed for subsequent encoding steps (by \"application/x-www-form-\nurlencoded\" [ W3C.REC-html401-19991224 ], for example), the base64url-\nencoded data MUST NOT be line wrapped and pad characters (\"=\") MUST\nNOT be included.\nThe \"scope\" parameter may be used, as defined in the OAuth Assertion\nFramework [ RFC7521 ], to indicate the requested scope.\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 4] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \nAuthentication of the client is optional, as described in\n Section 3.2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [ RFC6749 ] and consequently, the\n\"client_id\" is only needed when a form of client authentication that\nrelies on the parameter is used.\nThe following example demonstrates an access token request with an\nAssertion as an authorization grant (with extra line breaks for\ndisplay purposes only):\nPOST /token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: as.example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\ngrant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Asaml2-bearer&amp;\nassertion=PHNhbWxwOl...[omitted for brevity]...ZT4\n 2.2 . Using SAML Assertions for Client Authentication \nTo use a SAML Bearer Assertion for client authentication, the client\nuses the following parameter values and encodings.\nThe value of the \"client_assertion_type\" parameter is\n\"urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:saml2-bearer\".\nThe value of the \"client_assertion\" parameter MUST contain a single\nSAML 2.0 Assertion. The SAML Assertion XML data MUST be encoded\nusing base64url, where the encoding adheres to the definition in\n Section 5 of RFC 4648 [ RFC4648 ] and where the padding bits are set to\nzero. To avoid the need for subsequent encoding steps (by\n\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" [ W3C.REC-html401-19991224 ], for\nexample), the base64url-encoded data SHOULD NOT be line wrapped and\npad characters (\"=\") SHOULD NOT be included.\nThe following example demonstrates a client authenticating using an\nAssertion during the presentation of an authorization code grant in\nan access token request (with extra line breaks for display purposes\nonly):\nPOST /token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: as.example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\ngrant_type=authorization_code&amp;\ncode=n0esc3NRze7LTCu7iYzS6a5acc3f0ogp4&amp;\nclient_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth\n%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Asaml2-bearer&amp;\nclient_assertion=PHNhbW...[omitted for brevity]...ZT\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 5] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \n 3 . Assertion Format and Processing Requirements \nIn order to issue an access token response as described in OAuth 2.0\n[ RFC6749 ] or to rely on an Assertion for client authentication, the\nauthorization server MUST validate the Assertion according to the\ncriteria below. Application of additional restrictions and policy\nare at the discretion of the authorization server.\n1. The Assertion's &lt;Issuer&gt; element MUST contain a unique\nidentifier for the entity that issued the Assertion. In the\nabsence of an application profile specifying otherwise,\ncompliant applications MUST compare Issuer values using the\nSimple String Comparison method defined in Section 6.2.1 of RFC \n 3986 [ RFC3986 ].\n2. The Assertion MUST contain a &lt;Conditions&gt; element with an\n&lt;AudienceRestriction&gt; element with an &lt;Audience&gt; element that\nidentifies the authorization server as an intended audience.\n Section 2.5.1.4 of \"Assertions and Protocols for the OASIS\nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0\"\n[ OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os ] defines the &lt;AudienceRestriction&gt; and\n&lt;Audience&gt; elements and, in addition to the URI references\ndiscussed there, the token endpoint URL of the authorization\nserver MAY be used as a URI that identifies the authorization\nserver as an intended audience. The authorization server MUST\nreject any Assertion that does not contain its own identity as\nthe intended audience. In the absence of an application profile\nspecifying otherwise, compliant applications MUST compare the\nAudience values using the Simple String Comparison method\ndefined in Section 6.2.1 of RFC 3986 [ RFC3986 ]. As noted in\n Section 5 , the precise strings to be used as the Audience for a\ngiven authorization server must be configured out of band by the\nauthorization server and the issuer of the Assertion.\n3. The Assertion MUST contain a &lt;Subject&gt; element identifying the\nprincipal that is the subject of the Assertion. Additional\ninformation identifying the subject/principal MAY be included in\nan &lt;AttributeStatement&gt;.\nA. For the authorization grant, the Subject typically\nidentifies an authorized accessor for which the access token\nis being requested (i.e., the resource owner or an\nauthorized delegate), but in some cases, it may be a\npseudonymous identifier or other value denoting an anonymous\nuser.\nB. For client authentication, the Subject MUST be the\n\"client_id\" of the OAuth client.\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 6] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \n4. The Assertion MUST have an expiry that limits the time window\nduring which it can be used. The expiry can be expressed either\nas the NotOnOrAfter attribute of the &lt;Conditions&gt; element or as\nthe NotOnOrAfter attribute of a suitable\n&lt;SubjectConfirmationData&gt; element.\n5. The &lt;Subject&gt; element MUST contain at least one\n&lt;SubjectConfirmation&gt; element that has a Method attribute with a\nvalue of \"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer\". If the\nAssertion does not have a suitable NotOnOrAfter attribute on the\n&lt;Conditions&gt; element, the &lt;SubjectConfirmation&gt; element MUST\ncontain a &lt;SubjectConfirmationData&gt; element. When present, the\n&lt;SubjectConfirmationData&gt; element MUST have a Recipient\nattribute with a value indicating the token endpoint URL of the\nauthorization server (or an acceptable alias). The\nauthorization server MUST verify that the value of the Recipient\nattribute matches the token endpoint URL (or an acceptable\nalias) to which the Assertion was delivered. The\n&lt;SubjectConfirmationData&gt; element MUST have a NotOnOrAfter\nattribute that limits the window during which the Assertion can\nbe confirmed. The &lt;SubjectConfirmationData&gt; element MAY also\ncontain an Address attribute limiting the client address from\nwhich the Assertion can be delivered. Verification of the\nAddress is at the discretion of the authorization server.\n6. The authorization server MUST reject the entire Assertion if the\nNotOnOrAfter instant on the &lt;Conditions&gt; element has passed\n(subject to allowable clock skew between systems). The\nauthorization server MUST reject the &lt;SubjectConfirmation&gt; (but\nMAY still use the rest of the Assertion) if the NotOnOrAfter\ninstant on the &lt;SubjectConfirmationData&gt; has passed (subject to\nallowable clock skew). Note that the authorization server may\nreject Assertions with a NotOnOrAfter instant that is\nunreasonably far in the future. The authorization server MAY\nensure that Bearer Assertions are not replayed, by maintaining\nthe set of used ID values for the length of time for which the\nAssertion would be considered valid based on the applicable\nNotOnOrAfter instant.\n7. If the Assertion issuer directly authenticated the subject, the\nAssertion SHOULD contain a single &lt;AuthnStatement&gt; representing\nthat authentication event. If the Assertion was issued with the\nintention that the client act autonomously on behalf of the\nsubject, an &lt;AuthnStatement&gt; SHOULD NOT be included and the\nclient presenting the Assertion SHOULD be identified in the\n&lt;NameID&gt; or similar element in the &lt;SubjectConfirmation&gt;\nelement, or by other available means like \"SAML V2.0 Condition\nfor Delegation Restriction\" [ OASIS.saml-deleg-cs ].\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 7] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \n8. Other statements, in particular &lt;AttributeStatement&gt; elements,\nMAY be included in the Assertion.\n9. The Assertion MUST be digitally signed or have a Message\nAuthentication Code (MAC) applied by the issuer. The\nauthorization server MUST reject Assertions with an invalid\nsignature or MAC.\n10. Encrypted elements MAY appear in place of their plaintext\ncounterparts as defined in [ OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os ].\n11. The authorization server MUST reject an Assertion that is not\nvalid in all other respects per [ OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os ], such\nas (but not limited to) all content within the Conditions\nelement including the NotOnOrAfter and NotBefore attributes,\nunknown condition types, etc.\n 3.1 . Authorization Grant Processing \nAssertion authorization grants may be used with or without client\nauthentication or identification. Whether or not client\nauthentication is needed in conjunction with an Assertion\nauthorization grant, as well as the supported types of client\nauthentication, are policy decisions at the discretion of the\nauthorization server. However, if client credentials are present in\nthe request, the authorization server MUST validate them.\nIf the Assertion is not valid (including if its subject confirmation\nrequirements cannot be met), the authorization server constructs an\nerror response as defined in OAuth 2.0 [ RFC6749 ]. The value of the\n\"error\" parameter MUST be the \"invalid_grant\" error code. The\nauthorization server MAY include additional information regarding the\nreasons the Assertion was considered invalid using the\n\"error_description\" or \"error_uri\" parameters.\nFor example:\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\n{\n\"error\":\"invalid_grant\",\n\"error_description\":\"Audience validation failed\"\n}\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 8] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \n 3.2 . Client Authentication Processing \nIf the client Assertion is not valid (including if its subject\nconfirmation requirements cannot be met), the authorization server\nconstructs an error response as defined in OAuth 2.0 [ RFC6749 ]. The\nvalue of the \"error\" parameter MUST be the \"invalid_client\" error\ncode. The authorization server MAY include additional information\nregarding the reasons the Assertion was considered invalid using the\n\"error_description\" or \"error_uri\" parameters.\n 4 . Authorization Grant Example \nThe following examples illustrate what a conforming Assertion and an\naccess token request would look like.\nThe example shows an assertion issued and signed by the SAML Identity\nProvider identified as \"https://saml-idp.example.com\". The subject\nof the Assertion is identified by email address as\n\"brian@example.com\", who authenticated to the Identity Provider by\nmeans of a digital signature where the key was validated as part of\nan X.509 Public Key Infrastructure. The intended audience of the\nAssertion is \"https://saml-sp.example.net\", which is an identifier\nfor a SAML Service Provider with which the authorization server\nidentifies itself. The Assertion is sent as part of an access token\nrequest to the authorization server's token endpoint at\n\"https://authz.example.net/token.oauth2\".\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 9] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \nBelow is an example SAML 2.0 Assertion (whitespace formatting is for\ndisplay purposes only):\n&lt;Assertion IssueInstant=\"2010-10-01T20:07:34.619Z\"\nID=\"ef1xsbZxPV2oqjd7HTLRLIBlBb7\"\nVersion=\"2.0\"\nxmlns=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion\"&gt;\n&lt;Issuer&gt;https://saml-idp.example.com&lt;/Issuer&gt;\n&lt;ds:Signature xmlns:ds=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#\"&gt;\n[...omitted for brevity...]\n&lt;/ds:Signature&gt;\n&lt;Subject&gt;\n&lt;NameID\nFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress\"&gt;\nbrian@example.com\n&lt;/NameID&gt;\n&lt;SubjectConfirmation\nMethod=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:cm:bearer\"&gt;\n&lt;SubjectConfirmationData\nNotOnOrAfter=\"2010-10-01T20:12:34.619Z\"\nRecipient=\"https://authz.example.net/token.oauth2\"/&gt;\n&lt;/SubjectConfirmation&gt;\n&lt;/Subject&gt;\n&lt;Conditions&gt;\n&lt;AudienceRestriction&gt;\n&lt;Audience&gt;https://saml-sp.example.net&lt;/Audience&gt;\n&lt;/AudienceRestriction&gt;\n&lt;/Conditions&gt;\n&lt;AuthnStatement AuthnInstant=\"2010-10-01T20:07:34.371Z\"&gt;\n&lt;AuthnContext&gt;\n&lt;AuthnContextClassRef&gt;\nurn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:X509\n&lt;/AuthnContextClassRef&gt;\n&lt;/AuthnContext&gt;\n&lt;/AuthnStatement&gt;\n&lt;/Assertion&gt;\nFigure 1: Example SAML 2.0 Assertion\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 10] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \nTo present the Assertion shown in the previous example as part of an\naccess token request, for example, the client might make the\nfollowing HTTPS request (with extra line breaks for display purposes\nonly):\nPOST /token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: authz.example.net\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\ngrant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Asaml2-\nbearer&amp;assertion=PEFzc2VydGlvbiBJc3N1ZUluc3RhbnQ9IjIwMTEtMDU\n[...omitted for brevity...]aG5TdGF0ZW1lbnQ-PC9Bc3NlcnRpb24-\nFigure 2: Example Request\n 5 . Interoperability Considerations \nAgreement between system entities regarding identifiers, keys, and\nendpoints is required in order to achieve interoperable deployments\nof this profile. Specific items that require agreement are as\nfollows: values for the Issuer and Audience identifiers, the location\nof the token endpoint, the key used to apply and verify the digital\nsignature over the Assertion, one-time use restrictions on\nAssertions, maximum Assertion lifetime allowed, and the specific\nSubject and attribute requirements of the Assertion. The exchange of\nsuch information is explicitly out of scope for this specification,\nand typical deployment of it will be done alongside existing SAML Web\nSSO deployments that have already established a means of exchanging\nsuch information. \"Metadata for the OASIS Security Assertion Markup\nLanguage (SAML) V2.0\" [ OASIS.saml-metadata-2.0-os ] specifies one\ncommon method of exchanging SAML-related information about system\nentities.\nThe RSA-SHA256 algorithm, from [ RFC6931 ], is a mandatory-to-implement\nXML signature algorithm for this profile.\n 6 . Security Considerations \nThe security considerations described within the following\nspecifications are all applicable to this document: \"Assertion\nFramework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization\nGrants\" [ RFC7521 ], \"The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework\" [ RFC6749 ],\nand \"Security and Privacy Considerations for the OASIS Security\nAssertion Markup Language (SAML) V2.0\"\n[ OASIS.saml-sec-consider-2.0-os ].\n Campbell, et al. Standards Track [Page 11] \n \n RFC 7522 OAuth SAML Assertion Profiles May 2015 \nThe specification does not mandate replay protection for the SAML\nAssertion usage for either the authorization grant or for client\nauthentication. It is an optional feature, which implementations may\nemploy at their own discretion.\n 7 . Privacy Considerations \nA SAML Assertion may contain privacy-sensitive information and, to\nprevent disclosure of such information to unintended parties, should\nonly be transmitted over encrypted channels, such as Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS). In cases where it is desirable to prevent disclosure\nof certain information to the client, the Subject and/or individual\nattributes of a SAML Assertion should be encrypted to the\nauthorization server.\nDeployments should determine the minimum amount of information\nnecessary to complete the exchange and include only that information\nin an Assertion (typically by limiting what information is included\nin an &lt;AttributeStatement&gt; or by omitting it altogether). In some\ncases, the Subject can be a value representing an anonymous or\npseudonymous user, as described in Section 6.3.1 of the OAuth\nAssertion Framework [ RFC7521 ].\n 8 . IANA Considerations \n 8.1 .

Standards Track [Page 2] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \n 1 . Introduction \nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 [ OASIS-SAMLv2-CORE ] is\na set of specifications that provide various means for a user to be\nidentified to a Relying Party (RP) through the exchange of (typically\nsigned) assertions issued by an Identity Provider (IdP). It includes\na number of protocols, protocol bindings [ OASIS-SAMLv2-BIND ], and\ninteroperability profiles [ OASIS-SAMLv2-PROF ] designed for different\nuse cases.\nThe Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [ RFC4422 ] is a\ngeneralized mechanism for identifying and authenticating a user and\nfor optionally negotiating a security layer for subsequent protocol\ninteractions. SASL is used by application protocols like IMAP\n[ RFC3501 ], the Post Office Protocol (POP) [ RFC1939 ], and the\nExtensible Message and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [ RFC6120 ]. The\neffect is to make modular authentication, so that newer\nauthentication mechanisms can be added as needed. This memo\nspecifies just such a mechanism.\nThe Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)\n[ RFC2743 ] provides a framework for applications to support multiple\nauthentication mechanisms through a unified programming interface.\nThis document defines a pure SASL mechanism for SAML, but it conforms\nto the new bridge between SASL and the GSS-API called GS2 [ RFC5801 ].\nThis means that this document defines both a SASL mechanism and a\nGSS-API mechanism. The GSS-API interface is OPTIONAL for SASL\nimplementers, and the GSS-API considerations can be avoided in\nenvironments that use SASL directly without GSS-API.\nAs currently envisioned, this mechanism enables interworking between\nSASL and SAML in order to assert the identity of the user and other\nattributes to RPs. As such, while servers (as RPs) will advertise\nSASL mechanisms (including SAML), clients will select the SAML SASL\nmechanism as their SASL mechanism of choice.\nThe SAML mechanism described in this memo aims to reuse the Web\nBrowser Single Sign-On (SSO) profile defined in Section 4.1 of the\nSAML 2.0 profiles specification [ OASIS-SAMLv2-PROF ] to the maximum\nextent and therefore does not establish a separate authentication,\nintegrity, and confidentiality mechanism. The mechanism assumes that\na security layer, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) [ RFC5246 ],\nwill continue to be used. This specification is appropriate for use\nwhen a browser instance is available. In the absence of a browser\ninstance, SAML profiles that don't require a browser, such as the\nEnhanced Client or Proxy profile (as defined in Section 4.2 of\n[ OASIS-SAMLv2-PROF ], may be used, but that is outside the scope of\nthis specification.\n Wierenga, et al. Standards Track [Page 3] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \nFigure 1 describes the interworking between SAML and SASL: this\ndocument requires enhancements to the RP (the SASL server) and to the\nclient, as the two SASL communication end points, but no changes to\nthe SAML IdP are necessary. To accomplish this goal, some indirect\nmessaging is tunneled within SASL, and some use of external methods\nis made.\n+-----------+\n| |\n&gt;| Relying |\n/ | Party |\n// | |\n// +-----------+\nSAML/ // ^\nHTTPS // +--|--+\n// | S| |\n/ S | A| |\n// A | M| |\n// S | L| |\n// L | | |\n// | | |\n&lt;/ +--|--+\n+------------+ v\n| | +----------+\n| SAML | HTTPS | |\n| Identity |&lt;---------------&gt;| Client |\n| Provider | | |\n+------------+ +----------+\nFigure 1: Interworking Architecture\n 1.1 . Terminology \nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [ RFC2119 ].\nThe reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms used in the\nSAML 2.0 core specification [ OASIS-SAMLv2-CORE ].\n 1.2 . Applicability \nBecause this mechanism transports information that should not be\ncontrolled by an attacker, the SAML mechanism MUST only be used over\nchannels protected by TLS, or over similar integrity-protected and\nauthenticated channels. In addition, when TLS is used, the client\nMUST successfully validate the server's certificate ([ RFC5280 ],\n[ RFC6125 ]).\n Wierenga, et al. Standards Track [Page 4] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \nNote: An Intranet does not constitute such an integrity-protected and\nauthenticated channel!\n 2 . Authentication Flow \nWhile SAML itself is merely a markup language, its common use case\nthese days is with HTTP [ RFC2616 ] or HTTPS [ RFC2818 ] and HTML\n[ W3C-REC-HTML401 ]. What follows is a typical flow:\n1. The browser requests a resource of an RP (via an HTTP request).\n2. The RP redirects the browser via an HTTP redirect (as described\nin Section 10.3 of [RFC2616] ) to the IdP or an IdP discovery\nservice. When it does so, it includes the following parameters:\n(1) an authentication request that contains the name of the\nresource being requested, (2) a browser cookie, and (3) a return\nURL as specified in Section 3.1 of [ OASIS-SAMLv2-PROF ].\n3. The user authenticates to the IdP and perhaps authorizes the\nrelease of user attributes to the RP.\n4. In its authentication response, the IdP redirects (via an HTTP\nredirect) the browser back to the RP with an authentication\nassertion (stating that the IdP vouches that the subject has\nsuccessfully authenticated), optionally along with some\nadditional attributes.\n5. The RP now has sufficient identity information to approve access\nto the resource or not, and acts accordingly. The authentication\nis concluded.\nWhen considering this flow in the context of SASL, we note that while\nthe RP and the client both must change their code to implement this\nSASL mechanism, the IdP can remain untouched. The RP already has\nsome sort of session (probably a TCP connection) established with the\nclient. However, it may be necessary to redirect a SASL client to\nanother application or handler. The steps are as follows:\n1. The SASL server (RP) advertises support for the SASL SAML20\nmechanism to the client.\n2. The client initiates a SASL authentication with SAML20 and sends\na domain name that allows the SASL server to determine the\nappropriate IdP.\n Wierenga, et al. Standards Track [Page 5] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \n3. The SASL server transmits an authentication request encoded using\na Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as described in RFC 3986 \n[ RFC3986 ] and an HTTP redirect to the IdP corresponding to the\ndomain.\n4. The SASL client now sends a response consisting of \"=\".\nAuthentication continues via the normal SAML flow, and the SASL\nserver will receive the answer to the challenge out of band from\nthe SASL conversation.\n5. At this point, the SASL client MUST construct a URL containing\nthe content received in the previous message from the SASL\nserver. This URL is transmitted to the IdP either by the SASL\nclient application or an appropriate handler, such as a browser.\n6. Next, the user authenticates to the IdP. The manner in which the\nend user is authenticated to the IdP, and any policies\nsurrounding such authentication, are out of scope for SAML and\nhence for this document. This step happens out of band from\nSASL.\n7. The IdP will convey information about the success or failure of\nthe authentication back to the SASL server (RP) in the form of an\nauthentication statement or failure, using an indirect response\nvia the client browser or the handler (and with an external\nbrowser, client control should be passed back to the SASL\nclient). This step happens out of band from SASL.\n8. The SASL server sends an appropriate SASL response to the client.\nPlease note: What is described here is the case in which the client\nhas not previously authenticated. It is possible that the client\nalready holds a valid SAML authentication token so that the user does\nnot need to be involved in the process anymore, but that would still\nbe external to SASL. This is classic Web Single Sign-On, in which\nthe Web Browser client presents the authentication token (cookie) to\nthe RP without renewed user authentication at the IdP.\n Wierenga, et al. Standards Track [Page 6] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \nWith all of this in mind, the flow appears as follows in Figure 2:\nSASL Serv. Client IdP\n|&gt;-----(1)-----&gt;| | Advertisement\n| | |\n|&lt;-----(2)-----&lt;| | Initiation\n| | |\n|&gt;-----(3)-----&gt;| | Authentication Request\n| | |\n|&lt;-----(4)-----&lt;| | Response of \"=\"\n| | |\n| |&lt;- -(5,6) - -&gt;| Client&lt;&gt;IdP\n| | | Authentication\n| | |\n|&lt;- - - - - - - - - - -(7)- - -| Authentication Statement\n| | |\n|&gt;-----(8)-----&gt;| | SASL Completion with\n| | | Status\n| | |\n----- = SASL\n- - - = HTTP or HTTPS (external to SASL)\nFigure 2: Authentication Flow\n 3 . SAML SASL Mechanism Specification \nThis section specifies the details of the SAML SASL mechanism. See\n Section 5 of [RFC4422] for additional details.\nThe name of this mechanism is \"SAML20\". The mechanism is capable of\ntransferring an authorization identity (via the \"gs2-header\"). The\nmechanism does not offer a security layer.\nThe mechanism is client-first. The first mechanism message from the\nclient to the server is the \"initial-response\". As described in\n[ RFC4422 ], if the application protocol does not support sending a\nclient response together with the authentication request, the server\nwill send an empty server challenge to let the client begin. The\nsecond mechanism message is from the server to the client, containing\nthe SAML \"authentication-request\". The third mechanism message is\nfrom the client to the server and is the fixed message consisting of\n\"=\". The fourth mechanism message is from the server to the client,\nindicating the SASL mechanism outcome.\n Wierenga, et al. Standards Track [Page 7] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \n 3.1 . Initial Response \nA client initiates a SAML20 authentication with SASL by sending the\nGS2 header followed by the Identity Provider identifier (message 2 in\nFigure 2) and is defined using ABNF [ RFC5234 ] as follows:\ninitial-response = gs2-header IdP-Identifier\nIdP-Identifier = domain ; domain name with corresponding IdP\nThe gs2-header is used as follows:\n- The \"gs2-nonstd-flag\" MUST NOT be present.\n- The \"gs2-cb-flag\" MUST be set to \"n\" because channel-binding\n[ RFC5056 ] data cannot be integrity protected by the SAML\nnegotiation. (Note: In theory, channel-binding data could be\ninserted in the SAML flow by the client and verified by the\nserver, but that is currently not supported in SAML.)\n- The \"gs2-authzid\" carries the optional authorization identity as\nspecified in [ RFC5801 ] (not to be confused with the\nIdP-Identifier).\nA domain name is either a \"traditional domain name\" as described in\n[ RFC1035 ] or an \"internationalized domain name\" as described in\n[ RFC5890 ]. Clients and servers MUST treat the IdP-Identifier as a\ndomain name slot [ RFC5890 ]. They also SHOULD support\ninternationalized domain names (IDNs) in the IdP-Identifier field; if\nthey do so, all of the domain name's labels MUST be A-labels or\nNR-LDH labels [ RFC5890 ]. If necessary, internationalized labels MUST\nbe converted from U-labels to A-labels by using the Punycode encoding\n[ RFC3492 ] for A-labels prior to sending them to the SASL server, as\ndescribed in the protocol specification for Internationalized Domain\nNames in Applications [ RFC5891 ].\n 3.2 . Authentication Request \nThe SASL server transmits to the SASL client a URI that redirects the\nSAML client to the IdP (corresponding to the domain that the user\nprovided), with a SAML authentication request as one of the\nparameters (message 3 in Figure 2) using the following ABNF:\nauthentication-request = URI\nThe URI is specified in [ RFC3986 ] and is encoded according to\n Section 3.4 (\"HTTP Redirect Binding\") of the SAML 2.0 bindings\nspecification [ OASIS-SAMLv2-BIND ]. The SAML authentication request\nis encoded according to Section 3.4 (\"Authentication Request\n Wierenga, et al. Standards Track [Page 8] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \nProtocol\") of [ OASIS-SAMLv2-CORE ]. Should the client support\nInternationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [ RFC3987 ], it MUST\nfirst map the IRI to a URI before transmitting it to the server, as\ndefined in Section 3.1 of [RFC3987] .\nNote: The SASL server may have a static mapping of domain to\ncorresponding IdP or, alternatively, a DNS-lookup mechanism could be\nenvisioned, but that is out of scope for this document.\nNote: While the SASL client MAY sanity-check the URI it received,\nultimately it is the SAML IdP that will be validated by the SAML\nclient; this topic is out of scope for this document.\nThe client then sends the authentication request via an HTTP GET\n(sent over a server-authenticated TLS channel) to the IdP, as if\nredirected to do so from an HTTP server and in accordance with the\nWeb Browser SSO profile, as described in Section 4.1 of\n[ OASIS-SAMLv2-PROF ] (messages 5 and 6 in Figure 2).\nThe client handles both user authentication to the IdP and\nconfirmation or rejection of the authentication of the RP (out of\nscope for this document).\nAfter all authentication has been completed by the IdP, the IdP will\nsend a redirect message to the client in the form of a URI\ncorresponding to the RP as specified in the authentication request\n(\"AssertionConsumerServiceURL\") and with the SAML response as one of\nthe parameters (message 7 in Figure 2).\nPlease note: This means that the SASL server needs to implement a\nSAML RP. Also, the SASL server needs to correlate the session it has\nwith the SASL client with the appropriate SAML authentication result.\nIt can do so by comparing the ID of the SAML authentication request\nit has issued with the one it receives in the SAML authentication\nstatement.\n 3.3 . Outcome and Parameters \nThe SASL server (in its capacity as a SAML RP) now validates the SAML\nauthentication response it received from the SAML client via HTTP or\nHTTPS.\nThe outcome of that validation by the SASL server constitutes a SASL\nmechanism outcome and therefore (as stated in [ RFC4422 ]) SHALL be\nused to set state in the server accordingly, and it SHALL be used by\nthe server to report that state to the SASL client, as described in\n [RFC4422], Section 3.6 (message 8 in Figure 2).\n Wierenga, et al. Standards Track [Page 9] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \n 4 . SAML GSS-API Mechanism Specification \nThis section and its sub-sections are not required for SASL\nimplementors, but this section MUST be observed to implement the\nGSS-API mechanism discussed below.\nThis section specifies a GSS-API mechanism that, when used via the\nGS2 bridge to SASL, behaves like the SASL mechanism defined in this\ndocument. Thus, it can loosely be said that the SAML SASL mechanism\nis also a GSS-API mechanism. The SAML user takes the role of the\nGSS-API Initiator, and the SAML RP takes the role of the GSS-API\nAcceptor. The SAML IdP does not have a role in GSS-API and is\nconsidered an internal matter for the SAML mechanism. The messages\nare the same, but\na) the GS2 header on the client's first message and channel-binding\ndata are excluded when SAML is used as a GSS-API mechanism, and\nb) the initial context token header ( Section 3.1 of [RFC2743] ) is\nprefixed to the client's first authentication message (context\ntoken).\nThe GSS-API mechanism OID for SAML is 1.3.6.1.5.5.17 (see Section 7.2 \nfor more information). The DER encoding of the OID is\n0x2b 0x06 0x01 0x05 0x05 0x11.\nSAML20 security contexts MUST have the mutual_state flag\n(GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG) set to TRUE. SAML does not support credential\ndelegation; therefore, SAML security contexts MUST have the\ndeleg_state flag (GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG) set to FALSE.\nThe mutual authentication property of this mechanism relies on\nsuccessfully comparing the TLS server's identity with the negotiated\ntarget name. Since the TLS channel is managed by the application\noutside of the GSS-API mechanism, the mechanism itself is unable to\nconfirm the name, while the application is able to perform this\ncomparison for the mechanism. For this reason, applications MUST\nmatch the TLS server's identity with the target name, as discussed in\n[ RFC6125 ]. More precisely, to pass identity validation, the client\nuses the securely negotiated targ_name as the reference identifier\nand matches it to the DNS-ID of the server's certificate, and it MUST\nreject the connection if there is a mismatch. For compatibility with\ndeployed certificate hierarchies, the client MAY also perform a\ncomparison with the Common Name ID (CN-ID) when there is no DNS-ID\npresent. Wildcard matching is permitted. The targ_name reference\nidentifier is a \"traditional domain names\"; thus, the comparison is\nmade using case-insensitive ASCII comparison.\n Wierenga, et al. Standards Track [Page 10] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \nThe SAML mechanism does not support per-message tokens or the\nGSS_Pseudo_random() function [ RFC4401 ].\n 4.1 . GSS-API Principal Name Types for SAML \nSAML supports standard generic name syntaxes for acceptors such as\nGSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see [RFC2743], Section 4.1 ). SAML\nsupports only a single name type for initiators: GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME.\nGSS_C_NT_USER_NAME is the default name type for SAML. The query,\ndisplay, and exported name syntaxes for SAML principal names are all\nthe same. There are no SAML-specific name syntaxes -- applications\nshould use generic GSS-API name types, such as GSS_C_NT_USER_NAME and\nGSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE (see [RFC2743] Section 4 ). The exported\nname token, of course, conforms to [RFC2743], Section 3.2 .\n 5 . Examples \n 5.1 . XMPP \nSuppose the user has an identity at the SAML IdP saml.example.org and\na Jabber Identifier (JID) \"somenode@example.com\" and wishes to\nauthenticate his XMPP [ RFC6120 ] connection to xmpp.example.com. The\nauthentication on the wire would then look something like the\nfollowing:\nStep 1: Client initiates stream to server:\n&lt;stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client'\nxmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'\nto='example.com' version='1.0'&gt;\nStep 2: Server responds with a stream tag sent to client:\n&lt;stream:stream\nxmlns='jabber:client' xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'\nid='some_id' from='example.com' version='1.0'&gt;\nStep 3: Server informs client of available authentication mechanisms:\n&lt;stream:features&gt;\n&lt;mechanisms xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'&gt;\n&lt;mechanism&gt;DIGEST-MD5&lt;/mechanism&gt;\n&lt;mechanism&gt;PLAIN&lt;/mechanism&gt;\n&lt;mechanism&gt;SAML20&lt;/mechanism&gt;\n&lt;/mechanisms&gt;\n&lt;/stream:features&gt;\n Wierenga, et al.

Security Considerations \nThis section addresses only security considerations associated with\nthe use of SAML with SASL applications. For considerations relating\nto SAML in general, and for general SASL security considerations, the\nreader is referred to the SAML specifications and to other\nliterature.\n 6.1 . Man-in-the-Middle and Tunneling Attacks \nThis mechanism is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and tunneling\nattacks unless a client always verifies the server's identity before\nproceeding with authentication (see [ RFC6125 ]). Typically, TLS is\nused to provide a secure channel with server authentication.\n 6.2 . Binding SAML Subject Identifiers to Authorization Identities \nAs specified in [ RFC4422 ], the server is responsible for binding\ncredentials to a specific authorization identity. It is therefore\nnecessary that only specific trusted IdPs be allowed. This is a\ntypical part of SAML trust establishment between RPs and the IdP.\n Wierenga, et al. Standards Track [Page 17] \n \n RFC 6595 A SASL and GSS-API Mechanism for SAML April 2012 \n 6.3 . User Privacy \nThe IdP is aware of each RP that a user logs into. There is nothing\nin the protocol to hide this information from the IdP. It is not a\nrequirement to track the visits, but there is nothing that prohibits\nthe collection of information. SASL server implementers should be\naware that SAML IdPs will be able to track -- to some extent -- user\naccess to their services.\n 6.4 . Collusion between RPs \nIt is possible for RPs to link data that they have collected on the\nusers. By using the same identifier to log into every RP, collusion\nbetween RPs is possible. In SAML, targeted identity was introduced.\nTargeted identity allows the IdP to transform the identifier the user\ntyped in to an RP-specific opaque identifier. This way, the RP would\nnever see the actual user identifier but instead would see a randomly\ngenerated identifier.\n 6.5 . Security Considerations Specific to GSS-API \nSecurity issues inherent in GSS-API [ RFC2743 ] and GS2 [ RFC5801 ] apply\nto the SAML GSS-API mechanism defined in this document. Further, and\nas discussed in Section 4 , proper TLS server identity verification is\ncritical to the security of the mechanism.\n 7 . IANA Considerations \n 7.1 . IANA Mech-Profile \nThe IANA has registered the following SASL profile:\nSASL mechanism profile: SAML20\nSecurity Considerations: See this document\nPublished Specification: See this document\nFor further information: Contact the authors of this document.\nOwner/Change controller: the IETF\nIntended usage: COMMON\nNote: None\n Wierenga, et al.

            "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n \n Single sign-on ( SSO ) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.\n True single sign-on allows the user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors.\n It should not be confused with same-sign on (Directory Server Authentication), often accomplished by using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and stored LDAP databases on (directory) servers. [1] [2] \n A simple version of single sign-on can be achieved over IP networks using cookies but only if the sites share a common DNS parent domain. [3] \n For clarity, a distinction is made between Directory Server Authentication (same-sign on) and single sign-on: Directory Server Authentication refers to systems requiring authentication for each application but using the same credentials from a directory server, whereas single sign-on refers to systems where a single authentication provides access to multiple applications by passing the authentication token seamlessly to configured applications.\n Conversely, single sign-off or single log-out ( SLO ) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems.\n As different applications and resources support different authentication mechanisms, single sign-on must internally store the credentials used for initial authentication and translate them to the credentials required for the different mechanisms.\n Other shared authentication schemes, such as OpenID and OpenID Connect , offer other services that may require users to make choices during a sign-on to a resource, but can be configured for single sign-on if those other services (such as user consent) are disabled. [4] An increasing number of federated social logons, like Facebook Connect , do require the user to enter consent choices upon first registration with a new resource, and so are not always single sign-on in the strictest sense.\n \n Benefits [ edit ] \n Benefits of using single sign-on include:\n \n Mitigate risk for access to 3rd-party sites (\"federated authentication\") [5] because user passwords are not stored or managed externally \n Reduce password fatigue from different username and password combinations \n Reduce time spent re-entering passwords for the same identity [5] \n Reduce IT costs due to lower number of IT help desk calls about passwords [6] \n Simpler administration. SSO-related tasks are performed transparently as part of normal maintenance, using the same tools that are used for other administrative tasks. \n Better administrative control. All network management information is stored in a single repository. This means that there is a single, authoritative listing of each user's rights and privileges. This allows the administrator to change a user's privileges and know that the results will propagate network wide. \n Improved user productivity. Users are no longer bogged down by multiple logons, nor are they required to remember multiple passwords in order to access network resources. This is also a benefit to Help desk personnel, who need to field fewer requests for forgotten passwords. \n Better network security. Eliminating multiple passwords also reduces a common source of security breaches—users writing down their passwords. Finally, because of the consolidation of network management information, the administrator can know with certainty that when he disables a user's account, the account is fully disabled. \n Consolidation of heterogeneous networks. By joining disparate networks, administrative efforts can be consolidated, ensuring that administrative best practices and corporate security policies are being consistently enforced. \n SSO shares centralized authentication servers that all other applications and systems use for authentication purposes and combines this with techniques to ensure that users do not have to actively enter their credentials more than once.\n \n Criticism [ edit ] \n The term reduced sign-on (RSO) has been used by some to reflect the fact that single sign-on is impractical in addressing the need for different levels of secure access in the enterprise, and as such more than one authentication server may be necessary. [7] \n As single sign-on provides access to many resources once the user is initially authenticated (\"keys to the castle\"), it increases the negative impact in case the credentials are available to other people and misused. Therefore, single sign-on requires an increased focus on the protection of the user credentials, and should ideally be combined with strong authentication methods like smart cards and one-time password tokens. [7] \n Single sign-on also increases dependence on highly-available authentication systems; a loss of their availability can result in denial of access to all systems unified under the SSO. SSO can be configured with session failover capabilities in order to maintain the system operation. [8] Nonetheless, the risk of system failure may make single sign-on undesirable for systems to which access must be guaranteed at all times, such as security or plant-floor systems.\n Furthermore, the use of single-sign-on techniques utilizing social networking services such as Facebook may render third party websites unusable within libraries, schools, or workplaces that block social media sites for productivity reasons. It can also cause difficulties in countries with active censorship regimes, such as China and its \" Golden Shield Project \", where the third party website may not be actively censored, but is effectively blocked if a user's social login is blocked. [9] [10] \n \n Security [ edit ] \n In March 2012, [11] a research paper reported an extensive study on the security of social login mechanisms. The authors found 8 serious logic flaws in high-profile ID providers and relying party websites, such as OpenID (including Google ID and PayPal Access), Facebook , Janrain , Freelancer , FarmVille , and Sears.com . Because the researchers informed ID providers and relying party websites prior to public announcement of the discovery of the flaws, the vulnerabilities were corrected, and there have been no security breaches reported. [12] \n In May 2014, a vulnerability named Covert Redirect was disclosed. [13] It was first reported \"Covert Redirect Vulnerability Related to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID\" by its discoverer Wang Jing, a Mathematical PhD student from Nanyang Technological University , Singapore. [14] [15] [16] In fact, almost all [ weasel words ] Single sign-on protocols are affected. Covert Redirect takes advantage of third-party clients susceptible to an XSS or Open Redirect. [17] \n In December 2020, flaws in federated authentication systems were discovered to have been utilized by attackers during the 2020 United States federal government data breach . [18] [19] \n Due to how single sign-on works, by sending a request to the logged-in website to get a SSO token and sending a request with the token to the logged-out website, the token cannot be protected with the HttpOnly cookie flag and thus can be stolen by an attacker if there is an XSS vulnerability on the logged-out website, in order to do session hijacking . Another security issue is that if the session used for SSO is stolen (which can be protected with the HttpOnly cookie flag unlike the SSO token), the attacker can access all the websites that are using the SSO system. [20] \n \n Privacy [ edit ] \n As originally implemented in Kerberos and SAML, single sign-on did not give users any choices about releasing their personal information to each new resource that the user visited. This worked well enough within a single enterprise, like MIT where Kerberos was invented, or major corporations where all of the resources were internal sites. However, as federated services like Active Directory Federation Services proliferated, the user's private information was sent out to affiliated sites not under control of the enterprise that collected the data from the user. Since privacy regulations are now tightening with legislation like the GDPR , the newer methods like OpenID Connect have started to become more attractive; for example MIT, the originator of Kerberos, now supports OpenID Connect . [21] \n \n Email address [ edit ] \n Single sign-on in theory can work without revealing identifying information such as email addresses to the relying party (credential consumer), but many credential providers do not allow users to configure what information is passed on to the credential consumer. As of 2019, Google and Facebook sign-in do not require users to share email addresses with the credential consumer. \" Sign in with Apple \" introduced in iOS 13 allows a user to request a unique relay email address each time the user signs up for a new service, thus reducing the likelihood of account linking by the credential consumer. [22] \n \n Common configurations [ edit ] \n Kerberos-based [ edit ] \n Initial sign-on prompts the user for credentials, and gets a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT). \n Additional software applications requiring authentication, such as email clients , wikis , and revision-control systems, use the ticket-granting ticket to acquire service tickets, proving the user's identity to the mail-server / wiki server / etc. without prompting the user to re-enter credentials. \n Windows environment - Windows login fetches TGT. Active Directory -aware applications fetch service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.\n Unix / Linux environment - Login via Kerberos PAM modules fetches TGT. Kerberized client applications such as Evolution , Firefox , and SVN use service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.\n \n Smart-card-based [ edit ] \n Initial sign-on prompts the user for the smart card . Additional software applications also use the smart card, without prompting the user to re-enter credentials. Smart-card-based single sign-on can either use certificates or passwords stored on the smart card.\n \n Integrated Windows Authentication [ edit ] \n Integrated Windows Authentication is a term associated with Microsoft products and refers to the SPNEGO , Kerberos , and NTLMSSP authentication protocols with respect to SSPI functionality introduced with Microsoft Windows 2000 and included with later Windows NT -based operating systems. The term is most commonly used to refer to the automatically authenticated connections between Microsoft Internet Information Services and Internet Explorer . Cross-platform Active Directory integration vendors have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to Unix (including Mac) and Linux systems.\n \n Security Assertion Markup Language [ edit ] \n Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML -based method for exchanging user security information between an SAML identity provider and a SAML service provider . SAML 2.0 supports W3C XML encryption and service-provider–initiated web browser single sign-on exchanges. [23] A user wielding a user agent (usually a web browser) is called the subject in SAML-based single sign-on. The user requests a web resource protected by a SAML service provider. The service provider, wishing to know the identity of the user, issues an authentication request to a SAML identity provider through the user agent. The identity provider is the one that provides the user credentials. The service provider trusts the user information from the identity provider to provide access to its services or resources.\n \n Emerging configurations [ edit ] \n Mobile devices as access credentials [ edit ] \n A newer variation of single-sign-on authentication has been developed using mobile devices as access credentials. Users' mobile devices can be used to automatically log them onto multiple systems, such as building-access-control systems and computer systems, through the use of authentication methods which include OpenID Connect and SAML, [24] in conjunction with an X.509 ITU-T cryptography certificate used to identify the mobile device to an access server.\n A mobile device is \"something you have\", as opposed to a password which is \"something you know\", or biometrics (fingerprint, retinal scan, facial recognition, etc.) which is \"something you are\". Security experts recommend using at least two out of these three factors ( multi-factor authentication ) for best protection.\n \n See also [ edit ] \n Account pre-hijacking \n Central Authentication Service \n Identity management \n Identity management systems \n List of single sign-on implementations \n Password manager \n Security Assertion Markup Language \n Usability of web authentication systems \n References [ edit ] \n \n ^ \"What's the Difference b/w SSO (Single Sign On) &amp; LDAP?\" .

            "summary": "Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme allowing users to access multiple related systems using a single ID and password, eliminating the need to log in repeatedly.  While simple versions can use cookies (if sites share a common DNS domain),  more robust systems manage credentials internally, translating them for different authentication mechanisms.  SSO contrasts with directory server authentication (same-sign on), which uses the same credentials from a directory server for each application.  Benefits include reduced password fatigue, lower IT support costs, and simpler administration due to centralized user management.\n",

            "text": "However, if user opens a browser directly and goes to App B, then how\ndoes their session get established with existing token? \n If the answer is there's session state on the back-end server, then\nhow does session state match the user logged in App A with the new\nrequest for App B? \n \n I would say it's more about cookies and redirects than it is tokens. Tokens are generated once a user's identity is established. \n So when you hit App B via your browser, App B redirects your user-agent to the Auth Server (which may in turn redirect you to a SSO site). \n The thing to note is that the SSO login request is actually an HTTP request between your browser and the SSO server. \n So the SSO cookie is already there - because earlier, App A would have also redirected your user-agent to the Auth / SSO server where the login was performed.

Apps typically don't share tokens; instead, App B requests verification from the authentication server, checking permissions and user consent.

            "text": "You can access an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO) by authenticating through an identity provider (IdP). About authentication with SAML SSO \n SAML single sign-on (SSO) gives organization owners and enterprise owners a way to control and secure access to organization resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests. Organization owners can invite your personal account on GitHub to join their organization that uses SAML SSO, which allows you to contribute to the organization and retain your existing identity and contributions on GitHub. \n If you're a member of an enterprise with managed users, you will instead use a new account that is provisioned for you and controlled by your enterprise. For more information, see Types of GitHub accounts . \n When you attempt to access most resources within an organization that uses SAML SSO, GitHub will redirect you to the organization's SAML IdP to authenticate. After you successfully authenticate with your account on the IdP, the IdP redirects you back to GitHub, where you can access the organization's resources. \n IdP authentication is not required for accessing public repositories in certain ways: \n \n Viewing the repository's overview page and file contents on GitHub \n Forking the repository \n Performing read operations via Git, such as cloning the repository \n \n Authentication is required for other access to public repositories, such as viewing issues, pull requests, projects, and releases. \n Note \n \nSAML authentication is not required for outside collaborators. For more information about outside collaborators, see Roles in an organization . \n \n If you have recently authenticated with your organization's SAML IdP in your browser, you are automatically authorized when you access a GitHub organization that uses SAML SSO. If you haven't recently authenticated with your organization's SAML IdP in your browser, you must authenticate at the SAML IdP before you can access the organization. \n You must periodically authenticate with your SAML IdP to authenticate and gain access to the organization's resources on GitHub. The duration of this login period is specified by your IdP and is generally 24 hours. This periodic login requirement limits the length of access and requires you to re-identify yourself to continue. You can view and manage your active SAML sessions in your security settings. For more information, see Viewing and managing your active SAML sessions . \n Linked SAML identities \n When you authenticate with your IdP account and return to GitHub, GitHub will record a link in the organization or enterprise between your GitHub personal account and the SAML identity you signed into. This linked identity is used to validate your membership in that organization, and depending on your organization or enterprise setup, is also used to determine which organizations and teams you're a member of as well. Each GitHub account can be linked to exactly one SAML identity per organization. Likewise, each SAML identity can be linked to exactly one GitHub account in an organization. \n If you sign in with a SAML identity that is already linked to another GitHub account, you will receive an error message indicating that you cannot sign in with that SAML identity. This situation can occur if you are attempting to use a new GitHub account to work inside of your organization. If you didn't intend to use that SAML identity with that GitHub account, then you'll need to sign out of that SAML identity and then repeat the SAML login. If you do want to use that SAML identity with your GitHub account, you'll need to ask your admin to unlink your SAML identity from your old account, so that you can link it to your new account. Depending on the setup of your organization or enterprise, your admin may also need to reassign your identity within your SAML provider. For more information, see Viewing and managing a member's SAML access to your organization . \n If the SAML identity you sign in with does not match the SAML identity that is currently linked to your GitHub account, you'll receive a warning that you are about to relink your account. Because your SAML identity is used to govern access and team membership, continuing with the new SAML identity can cause you to lose access to teams and organizations inside of GitHub. Only continue if you know that you're supposed to use that new SAML identity for authentication in the future. \n To use the API or Git on the command line to access protected content in an organization that uses SAML SSO, you will need to use an authorized personal access token over HTTPS or an authorized SSH key. \n If you don't have a personal access token or an SSH key, you can create a personal access token for the command line or generate a new SSH key. For more information, see Managing your personal access tokens or Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent . \n To use a new or existing personal access token or SSH key with an organization that uses or enforces SAML SSO, you will need to authorize the token or authorize the SSH key for use with a SAML SSO organization. For more information, see Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on or Authorizing an SSH key for use with SAML single sign-on . \n About OAuth apps, GitHub Apps, and SAML SSO \n You must have an active SAML session each time you authorize an OAuth app or GitHub App to access an organization that uses or enforces SAML SSO. You can create an active SAML session by navigating to https://github.com/orgs/ORGANIZATION-NAME/sso in your browser. \n After an enterprise or organization owner enables or enforces SAML SSO for an organization, and after you authenticate via SAML for the first time, you must reauthorize any OAuth apps or GitHub Apps that you previously authorized to access the organization. \n To see the OAuth apps you've authorized, visit your OAuth apps page . To see the GitHub Apps you've authorized, visit your GitHub Apps page . \n For more information, see SAML and GitHub Apps . \n Further reading \n \n About identity and access management with SAML single sign-on",

This is typically done by an identity provider (IdP) that issues a token to the user, which is then passed to the different applications the user wants to access. \n OAuth, on the other hand, is an open standard for authorization (not authentication). It allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources (e.g. data) without sharing their credentials. OAuth does not provide authentication, but it can be used in conjunction with other protocols, such as SSO, to provide a seamless user experience. \n In summary, SSO is used for authenticating users, while OAuth is used for granting access to resources. OAuth can be used as part of an SSO solution, but it is not a replacement for SSO. \n \n \n \n \nanswered Dec 18, 2023 at 12:52 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \n OAuth (Open Authorization) 2.0 is an authorization protocol that allows users to grant one app limited access to their data on another app or service. \n SSO (Single Sign-On) is an authentication method that allows users to authenticate once with an Identity Provider (IdP) and gain access to multiple apps. \n \n \n \n \nanswered Dec 1, 2024 at 17:57 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n SSO can be validated via SAML(Security Assertion Markup Language) or OIDC(Open ID Connect). \n OIDC is built on the flow of OAuth2, so you will see strong similarities with OAuth2 when using SSO(OIDC). But OAuth is very different from SSO because it only caters to authorization, not authentication. \n \n If I have a single set of credentials that allow me to access 4\ndifferent platforms, that is SSO.

            "text": "A nice overview of SSO, which is also known as federation. Leaves out some of the more complicated aspects of SSO, such as: * Logout (surprisingly complicated, see this video for more: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=96m7DDQBW0U ) * Linking accounts (if you let someone login with Google, then also let them login with email and they use the same Gmail address, is it one account or two?) * Verifying account ownership (more important for if anyone can register under any email address) * Setting up the SSO integration (how does Google know how to trust Trello?) \n \n \n \n Actually logout is not complicated. But openidconnect allows single-logout , which most of the time, you do not even need. \n \n \n \n \n \n The thing is, most of the time you don’t want single logout. You want to logout of the specific application, not from the idp and all rp‘s. Think about it, which user want to logout from your app and entra id and all the rp‘s? Probably only a few. \n \n \n \n \n It really depends what you are doing.\nIf you control your own idp and you have multiple rp‘s you probably need it tough, but in this case a lot of things are hard, no matter if you use openid connect or nothing. Btw. even if you target entra id or other idp‘s it’s always a good idea to also have a way to trigger the single logout, some people might need it, so it is good to have it behind an Option.\nAlso you should at least implement the backchannel logout.\nBut as said none is really a requirement and often you just use an upfront idp as a second way to login and maintain your own user data in this case single logout is just an addon not a necessity. \n \n \n \n SSO protocols work great until you try to implement then 100% to spec. Then you realize how many vendors do weird shit with their SPs. \n \n \n \n Like what Michael said, there are a number of companies willing to act as an adapter for your SSO needs. My employer, FusionAuth, is another. Agreed that every SP is slightly different. There's a reason the SAML spec is 800+ pages, it covers a lot of variations. Since it has not been substantially updated since, there are some legacy choices (hello XML). We also maintain an open source java SAML library:\n https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-samlv2 SSO is simple on the surface and complex once you peel it back! \n \n \n \n \n The author's posts are well written. I browsed through several related articles because I'm doing some work in the authz/authn space right now and this helps to get my head back into it a bit. None of the articles seem to go super deep, but that's ok. I'm also in the middle of reading OpenID Connect In Action. It seems ok, but rather dry so far. Maybe the subject material is just inherently a bit tedious and boring to me personally. Does anyone have any good posts or books they would recommend for getting a better grasp on some of the authentication protocols? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This isn’t about passwords. The token from the identity server (Google in this case), describes the user, including their identity - which you may use as a link to the user data. If I were to forge an token, I could impersonate the user. For this reason, you need to verify the token with the identity server.",

            "text": "The Storage Access API provides a way for cross-site content loaded in a third-party context (i.e., embedded in an &lt;iframe&gt; ) to gain access to third-party cookies and unpartitioned state that it would typically only have access to in a first-party context (i.e., when loaded directly in a browser tab). \n The Storage Access API is relevant to user agents that, by default, block access to third-party cookies and unpartitioned state to improve privacy (for example, to prevent tracking). There are legitimate uses for third-party cookies and unpartitioned state that we still want to enable, even with these default restrictions in place. Examples include single sign-on (SSO) with federated identity providers (IdPs), or persisting user details such as location data or viewing preferences across different sites. \n The API provides methods that allow embedded resources to check whether they currently have access to third-party cookies and, if not, to request access from the user agent. Concepts and usage Browsers implement several storage access features and policies restricting access to third-party cookies and unpartitioned state. These range from giving embedded resources under each top-level origin a unique cookie storage space ( partitioned cookies ) to outright blocking of cookie access when resources are loaded in a third-party context. \n The semantics around third-party cookie and unpartitioned state blocking features and policies differ from browser to browser, but the core functionality is similar. Cross-site resources embedded in a third-party context are not given access to the same state that they would have access to when loaded in a first-party context. This is done with good intent — browser vendors want to take steps to better protect their user's privacy and security. Examples include leaving them less open to having their activity tracked across different sites, and less vulnerable to exploits such as cross-site request forgery ( CSRF ). \n However, there are legitimate uses for embedded cross-site content accessing third-party cookies and unpartitioned state, which the above features and policies are known to break. Let's say you've got a series of different sites that provide access to different products — heads-example.com , shoulders-example.com , knees-example.com , and toes-example.com . \n Alternatively, you might separate your content or services into different country domains for localization purposes — example.com , example.ua , example.br , etc. — or in some other way. \n You might have accompanying utility sites with components embedded in all the other sites, for example, to provide SSO ( sso-example.com ) or general personalization services ( services-example.com ). These utility sites will want to share their state with the sites they are embedded in via cookies. They cannot share first-party cookies because they are on different domains, and third-party cookies will no longer work in browsers that block them. \n In such situations, site owners often encourage users to add their site as an exception or to disable third-party cookie-blocking policies entirely. Users who wish to continue interacting with their content must significantly relax their blocking policy for resources loaded from all embedded origins and possibly across all websites. \n The Storage Access API is intended to solve this problem; embedded cross-site content can request unrestricted access to third-party cookies and unpartitioned state on a frame-by-frame basis via the Document.requestStorageAccess() method. It can also check whether it already has access via the Document.hasStorageAccess() method. Unpartitioned versus partitioned cookies It is important to note that the Storage Access API is only needed to provide access to unpartitioned third-party cookies. This means cookies stored in the traditional way since the early web — all cookies set on the same site are stored in the same cookie jar. This is in contrast to partitioned cookies, where embedded resources under each top-level site are given a unique cookie storage space, thereby making tracking users across sites via these cookies impossible. \n Browsers have various mechanisms to partition third-party cookie access, for example Firefox Total Cookie Protection and Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) . \n When we talk about third-party cookies in the context of the Storage Access API, we implicitly mean unpartitioned third-party cookies. How it works Embedded content that has a legitimate need for third party cookie or unpartitioned state access can request access using the Storage Access API as follows: \n \n It can call the Document.hasStorageAccess() method to check whether it has the access it needs already. \n If not, it can request access via the Document.requestStorageAccess() method. \n Depending on the browser, the user will be asked whether to grant access to the requesting embed in slightly different ways.\n \n Safari shows prompts for all embedded content that has not previously received storage access. \n Firefox only prompts users after an origin has requested storage access on more than a threshold number of sites. \n Chrome shows prompts for all embedded content that has not previously received storage access. It will however automatically grant access and skip prompts if the embedded content and embedding site are part of the same related website set . \n \n \n Access is granted or denied based on whether the content meets all the security requirements — see Security measures for general requirements, and Browser-specific variations for some browser-specific security requirements. The Promise -based nature of requestStorageAccess() allows you to run code to handle success and failure cases.\n \n Modern spec behavior dictates that access is granted per-frame — every separate content embed has its third-party cookie access blocked by default, and needs to call requestStorageAccess() to opt in to access. If a content embed has received access, and same-site embeds then call requestStorageAccess() , their promises will fulfill automatically. But they still need to opt in. \n The only exception to the \"blocked by default\" behavior is when a content embed makes a successful requestStorageAccess() , but then performs a same-origin navigation (for example reloading itself). In such cases, the storage access is carried over from the previous navigation. \n In older spec versions, the access was per-page (Safari is the only browser still using this model). When one embed received third-party cookie access via requestStorageAccess() , all other same-site embeds would automatically receive access. This was not desirable behavior from a security standpoint — for example, if shop.example.com embedded locator.users.com to allow users to use their location info while shopping, and locator.users.com called requestStorageAccess() , shop.example.com and any other sites it embeds would be able to access its cookies, but also access cookies from private.users.com , which is not intended to be embedded. Read more about the motivations behind this change. \n \n \n Once access is granted, a permission key is stored in the browser with the structure &lt;top-level site, embedded site&gt; . For example, if the embedding site is embedder.com , and the embed is locator.example.com , the key would be &lt;embedder.com, example.com&gt; . Same-site embeds ( docs.example.com , profile.example.com , etc.) would then be able to call requestStorageAccess() and the promise would fulfill automatically, as mentioned earlier.\n \n Older spec versions used the more specific permission key structure &lt;top-level site, embedded origin&gt; , which meant that same-site, cross-origin embeds didn't match the permission key and had to go through the whole process separately. \n \n \n \n Note: In cases where a top-level site has its cookies partitioned , the Storage Access API isn't required, as sharing the cookies by default has no privacy risk. Security measures Several different security measures could cause a Document.requestStorageAccess() call to fail. Check the below list if you are having trouble getting a request to work: \n \n The call must be associated with a user gesture ( transient activation ) such as a tap or click. This prevents embedded content on the page from spamming the browser or user with excessive access requests. Note that this isn't required if:\n \n Permission to use the API has already been granted, for example by another same-site resource calling requestStorageAccess() . \n The caller is a top-level document or same-site to the top-level document. In such cases, requestStorageAccess() probably doesn't need to be called at all. \n \n \n The document and top-level document must not have a null origin. \n Origins that have never been interacted with as a first party do not have a notion of first-party storage. From the user's perspective, they only have a third-party relationship with that origin. Access requests are automatically denied if the browser detects that the user hasn't interacted with the embedded content in a first-party context recently (in Firefox, \"recently\" means within 30 days). \n The document's window must be a secure context . \n Sandboxed &lt;iframe&gt; s cannot be granted storage access by default for security reasons. The API therefore also adds the allow-storage-access-by-user-activation sandbox token . The embedding website needs to add this to allow storage access requests to be successful, along with allow-scripts and allow-same-origin to allow it to execute a script to call the API and execute it in an origin that can have cookies/state:\n &lt; iframe \n sandbox = \" allow-storage-access-by-user-activation\nallow-scripts\nallow-same-origin \" &gt; \n…\n &lt;/ iframe &gt; \n \n \n Usage of this feature may be blocked by a storage-access Permissions Policy set on your server. \n \n Note: The document may also be required to pass additional browser-specific checks. Examples: allowlists, blocklists, on-device classification, user settings, anti- clickjacking heuristics, or prompting the user for explicit permission. Browser-specific variations Although the API surface is the same, websites using the Storage Access API should expect differences in the level and extent of third-party cookie access they receive between different browsers, due to differences in their storage access policies. Chrome \n Cookies must have SameSite=None explicitly set on them, because the default value for Chrome is SameSite=Lax ( SameSite=None is the default in Firefox and Safari). \n Cookies must have the Secure attribute set on them. \n The storage access grants are phased out after 30 days of browser usage passed without user interaction. Interaction with the embedded content extends this limit by another 30 days. This doesn't occur when Document.requestStorageAccessFor() is called because the user is already on the page. \n Firefox \n If the embedded origin tracker.example has already obtained third-party cookie access on the top-level origin foo.example , and the user visits a page from foo.example embedding a page from tracker.example again in less than 30 days, the embedded origin will have third-party cookie access immediately when loading. \n The storage access grants are phased out after 30 calendar days have passed. \n \n Documentation for Firefox's new storage access policy for blocking tracking cookies includes a detailed description of the scope of storage access grants. Safari \n The storage access grants are phased out after 30 days of browser usage passed without user interaction. Successful use of the Storage Access API resets this counter. \n Examples \n See Using the Storage Access API for an implementation guide with code examples. \n See Storage Access API Demo for a live demo. \n API methods \n Document.hasStorageAccess() \n \n Returns a Promise that resolves with a boolean value indicating whether the document has access to third-party cookies. \n \n Document.hasUnpartitionedCookieAccess() \n \n New name for Document.hasStorageAccess() . \n \n Document.requestStorageAccess() \n \n Allows content loaded in a third-party context (i.e., embedded in an &lt;iframe&gt; ) to request access to third-party cookies and unpartitioned state; returns a Promise that resolves if the access was granted, and rejects if access was denied. \n \n Document.requestStorageAccessFor() \n Experimental \n \n \n A proposed extension to the Storage Access API that allows top-level sites to request third-party cookie access on behalf of embedded content originating from another site in the same related website set . Returns a Promise that resolves if the access was granted, and rejects if access was denied. \n \n \n Note: User interaction propagates to the promise returned by these methods, allowing the callers to take actions requiring user interaction without requiring a second click. For example, a caller could open a pop-up window from the resolved promise without triggering Firefox's pop-up blocker. Additions to other APIs \n Permissions.query() , the \"storage-access\" feature name \n \n In supporting browsers, this can query whether third-party cookie access has been granted in general, that is, to another same-site embed. If so, you can call requestStorageAccess() without user interaction, and the promise will resolve automatically. \n \n Permissions.query() , the \"top-level-storage-access\" feature name \n Experimental \n \n \n A separate feature name used to query whether permission to access third-party cookies has already been granted via requestStorageAccessFor() . If so, you don't need to call requestStorageAccessFor() again. \n \n Specifications Specification The Storage Access API Extending Storage Access API (SAA) to non-cookie storage Browser compatibility api.Document.hasStorageAccess BCD tables only load in the browser api.Document.hasUnpartitionedCookieAccess BCD tables only load in the browser api.Document.requestStorageAccess BCD tables only load in the browser api.Document.requestStorageAccessFor BCD tables only load in the browser api.Permissions.permission_storage-access BCD tables only load in the browser See also",

            "text": "A federated identity system is one in which an identity provider (IdP) acts as an intermediary between users and relying parties , enabling a user to use a single set of credentials to authenticate with a number of different relying parties. \n Traditionally, on the web, a user will sign into a website with a username and a password, and the password is verified by the website against a (properly hashed and salted ) copy stored on the website's backend. \n In this model, if users have multiple accounts with different websites, they have to remember many passwords, and this encourages bad password practices such as using the same password for multiple accounts. \n In a federated identity system, an identity provider: \n \n manages a user's credentials and can authenticate users \n is trusted by multiple websites to make assertions about a user's identity. \n \n A user can then authenticate with the identity provider, which will return a token to the user's browser if authentication is successful. The user's browser will send the token to the website, which can verify that it was issued by the IdP. If the verification succeeds, the website can sign the user in. \n Federated identity is often provided as a service by corporations: for example, users who have Google, Microsoft, or Facebook accounts can use them to sign in to many websites. Websites typically have to implement a process for verifying tokens that is specific to an identity provider. However, open standards such as OpenID , OAuth , and SAML are widely used in the implementation of federated identity systems. \n Although federated identity makes logging into multiple different accounts much easier for users and can greatly improve security, it can have serious implications for a user's privacy. If not carefully designed, a federated identity system can allow identity providers to track users across the web as they sign into multiple different sites. Early federated identity systems on the web were built on technologies such as third-party cookies, which are intrinsically privacy-invasive. As these technologies are being deprecated by browsers, new approaches are needed. The Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API provides a standardized privacy-preserving mechanism for federated identity on the web. See also",

It is typically used with\nboolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value.

If a value can be converted to false , the value is\nso-called falsy .\n \n Examples of expressions that can be converted to false are: \n \n null ; \n NaN ; \n 0 ; \n empty string ( \"\" or '' or `` ); \n undefined . \n \n \nEven though the || operator can be used with operands that are not Boolean\nvalues, it can still be considered a boolean operator since its return value can always\nbe converted to a boolean primitive .\nTo explicitly convert its return value (or any expression in general) to the\ncorresponding boolean value, use a double NOT operator or the Boolean() \nconstructor.\n Short-circuit evaluation \nThe logical OR expression is evaluated left to right, it is tested for possible\n\"short-circuit\" evaluation using the following rule:\n \n \n (some truthy expression) || expr is short-circuit evaluated to\nthe truthy expression.\n \n \nShort circuit means that the expr part above is not\nevaluated , hence any side effects of doing so do not take effect (e.g., if\n expr is a function call, the calling never takes place). This\nhappens because the value of the operator is already determined after the evaluation of\nthe first operand.

            "text": "Secure context: This feature is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), in some or all supporting browsers . \n The Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) is an extension of the Credential Management API that enables strong authentication with public key cryptography, enabling passwordless authentication and secure multi-factor authentication (MFA) without SMS texts. \n WebAuthn concepts and usage WebAuthn uses asymmetric (public-key) cryptography instead of passwords or SMS texts for registering, authenticating, and multi-factor authentication with websites. This has some benefits: \n \n Protection against phishing: An attacker who creates a fake login website can't login as the user because the signature changes with the origin of the website. \n Reduced impact of data breaches: Developers don't need to hash the public key, and if an attacker gets access to the public key used to verify the authentication, it can't authenticate because it needs the private key. \n Invulnerable to password attacks: Some users might reuse passwords, and an attacker may obtain the user's password for another website (e.g. via a data breach). Also, text passwords are much easier to brute-force than a digital signature. \n \n Many websites already have pages that allow users to register new accounts or sign into an existing account, and WebAuthn acts as a replacement or enhancement for the authentication part of the system. It extends the Credential Management API , abstracting communication between the user agent and an authenticator and providing the following new functionality: \n \n When navigator.credentials.create() is used with the publicKey option, the user agent creates new credentials via an authenticator — either for registering a new account or for associating a new asymmetric key pair with an existing account.\n \n When registering a new account, these credentials are stored on a server (also referred to as a service or a relying party ) and can be subsequently used to log a user in. \n The asymmetric key pair is stored in the authenticator, which can then be used to authenticate a user with a relying party for example during MFA. The authenticator may be embedded into the user agent, into an operating system, such as Windows Hello, or it may be a physical token, such as a USB or Bluetooth Security Key. \n \n \n When navigator.credentials.get() is used with the publicKey option, the user agent uses an existing set of credentials to authenticate to a relying party (either as the primary login or to provide an additional factor during MFA as described above). \n \n In their most basic forms, both create() and get() receive a very large random number called the \"challenge\" from the server and return the challenge signed by the private key back to the server. This proves to the server that a user has the private key required for authentication without revealing any secrets over the network. \n Note: The \"challenge\" must be a buffer of random information at least 16 bytes in size. Creating a key pair and registering a user To illustrate how the credential creation process works, let's describe the typical flow that occurs when a user wants to register a credential to a relying party: \n \n The relying party server sends user and relying party information to the web app handling the registration process, along with the \"challenge\", using an appropriate secure mechanism (for example Fetch or XMLHttpRequest ).\n \n Note: The format for sharing information between the relying party server and the web app is up to the application.\nA recommended approach is to exchange JSON type representation objects for credentials and credential options.\nConvenience methods have been created in PublicKeyCredential for converting from the JSON representations to the form required by the authentication APIs: parseCreationOptionsFromJSON() , parseRequestOptionsFromJSON() and PublicKeyCredential.toJSON() .\n \n \n \nThe web app initiates generation of a new credential via the authenticator, on behalf of the relying party, via a navigator.credentials.create() call. This call is passed a publicKey option specifying device capabilities, e.g., whether the device provides its own user authentication (for example with biometrics).\nA typical create() call might look like so:\n let credential = await navigator . credentials . create ( { \n publicKey : { \n challenge : new Uint8Array ( [ 117 , 61 , 252 , 231 , 191 , 241 , ... ] ) , \n rp : { id : \"acme.com\" , name : \"ACME Corporation\" } , \n user : { \n id : new Uint8Array ( [ 79 , 252 , 83 , 72 , 214 , 7 , 89 , 26 ] ) , \n name : \"jamiedoe\" , \n displayName : \"Jamie Doe\" \n } , \n pubKeyCredParams : [ { type : \"public-key\" , alg : - 7 } ] \n } \n } ) ; \n The parameters of the create() call are passed to the authenticator, along with a SHA-256 hash that is signed to ensure that it isn't tampered with.\n \n After the authenticator obtains user consent, it generates a key pair and returns the public key and optional signed attestation to the web app. This is provided when the Promise returned by the create() call fulfills, in the form of a PublicKeyCredential object instance (the PublicKeyCredential.response property contains the attestation information). \n The web app forwards the PublicKeyCredential to the server, again using an appropriate mechanism. \n The server stores the public key, coupled with the user identity, to remember the credential for future authentications. During this process, it performs a series of checks to ensure that the registration was complete and not tampered with. These include:\n \n Verifying that the challenge is the same as the challenge that was sent. \n Ensuring that the origin was the origin expected. \n Validating that the signature and attestation are using the correct certificate chain for the specific model of the authenticator used to generated the key par in the first place. \n \n \n \n Warning: Attestation provides a way for a relying party to determine the provenance of an authenticator. Relying parties should not attempt to maintain allowlists of authenticators. Authenticating a user After a user has registered with WebAuthn, they can authenticate (i.e., login) with the service. The authentication flow looks similar to the registration flow, the main differences being that authentication: \n \n Doesn't require user or relying party information \n Creates an assertion using the previously-generated key pair for the service, rather than the authenticator's key pair. \n \n A typical authentication flow is as follows: \n \n The relying party generates a \"challenge\" and sends it to the user agent using an appropriate secure mechanism, along with a list of relying party and user credentials. It can also indicate where to look for the credential, e.g., on a local built-in authenticator, or on an external one over USB, BLE, etc. \n \nThe browser asks the authenticator to sign the challenge via a navigator.credentials.get() call, which is passed the credentials in a publicKey option.\nA typical get() call might look like so:\n let credential = await navigator . credentials . get ( { \n publicKey : { \n challenge : new Uint8Array ( [ 139 , 66 , 181 , 87 , 7 , 203 , ... ] ) , \n rpId : \"acme.com\" , \n allowCredentials : [ { \n type : \"public-key\" , \n id : new Uint8Array ( [ 64 , 66 , 25 , 78 , 168 , 226 , 174 , ... ] ) \n } ] , \n userVerification : \"required\" , \n } \n } ) ; \n The parameters of the get() call are passed to the authenticator to handle the authentication.\n \n If the authenticator contains one of the given credentials and is able to successfully sign the challenge, it returns a signed assertion to the web app after receiving user consent. This is provided when the Promise returned by the get() call fulfills, in the form of a PublicKeyCredential object instance (the PublicKeyCredential.response property contains the assertion information). \n The web app forwards the signed assertion to the relying party server for the relying party to validate. The validation checks include:\n \n Using the public key that was stored during the registration request to validate the signature by the authenticator. \n Ensuring that the challenge that was signed by the authenticator matches the challenge that was generated by the server. \n Checking that the Relying Party ID is the one expected for this service. \n \n \n Once verified by the server, the authentication flow is considered successful. \n Controlling access to the API The availability of WebAuthn can be controlled using a Permissions Policy , specifying two directives in particular: \n \n publickey-credentials-create : Controls the availability of navigator.credentials.create() with the publicKey option. \n publickey-credentials-get : Controls the availability of navigator.credentials.get() with the publicKey option. \n \n \nBoth directives have a default allowlist value of \"self\" , meaning that by default these methods can be used in top-level document contexts.\nIn addition, get() can be used in nested browsing contexts loaded from the same origin as the top-most document.\n get() and create() can be used in nested browsing contexts loaded from the different origins to the top-most document (i.e. in cross-origin &lt;iframes&gt; ), if allowed by the publickey-credentials-get and publickey-credentials-create Permission-Policy directives, respectively.\nFor cross-origin create() calls, where the permission was granted by allow= on an iframe , the frame must also have Transient activation .\n \n Note: Where a policy forbids use of these methods, the promises returned by them will reject with a NotAllowedError DOMException . Basic access control If you wish to allow access to a specific subdomain only, you could provide it like this: \n Permissions-Policy : publickey-credentials-get=(\"https://subdomain.example.com\") \n Permissions-Policy : publickey-credentials-create=(\"https://subdomain.example.com\") \n Allowing embedded create and get() calls in an &lt;iframe&gt; If you wish to authenticate with get() or create() in an &lt;iframe&gt; , there are a couple of steps to follow: \n \n The site embedding the relying party site must provide permission via an allow attribute:\n \n If using get() :\n &lt; iframe \n src = \" https://auth.provider.com \" \n allow = \" publickey-credentials-get * \" &gt; \n &lt;/ iframe &gt; \n \n \n If using create() :\n &lt; iframe \n src = \" https://auth.provider.com \" \n allow = \" publickey-credentials-create 'self' https://a.auth.provider.com https://b.auth.provider.com \" &gt; \n &lt;/ iframe &gt; \n The &lt;iframe&gt; must also have Transient activation if create() is called cross-origin.\n \n \n \n The relying party site must provide permission for the above access via a Permissions-Policy header:\n Permissions-Policy : publickey-credentials-get=* \n Permissions-Policy : publickey-credentials-create=* \n Or to allow only a specific URL to embed the relying party site in an &lt;iframe&gt; :\n Permissions-Policy : publickey-credentials-get=(\"https://subdomain.example.com\") \n Permissions-Policy : publickey-credentials-create=(\"https://*.auth.provider.com\") \n \n \n Interfaces \n AuthenticatorAssertionResponse \n \n Provides proof to a service that an authenticator has the necessary key pair to successfully handle an authentication request initiated by a CredentialsContainer.get() call. Available in the response property of the PublicKeyCredential instance obtained when the get() Promise fulfills. \n \n AuthenticatorAttestationResponse \n \n The result of a WebAuthn credential registration (i.e., a CredentialsContainer.create() call). It contains information about the credential that the server needs to perform WebAuthn assertions, such as its credential ID and public key. Available in the response property of the PublicKeyCredential instance obtained when the create() Promise fulfills. \n \n AuthenticatorResponse \n \n The base interface for AuthenticatorAttestationResponse and AuthenticatorAssertionResponse . \n \n PublicKeyCredential \n \n Provides information about a public key / private key pair, which is a credential for logging in to a service using an un-phishable and data-breach resistant asymmetric key pair instead of a password. Obtained when the Promise returned via a create() or get() call fulfills. \n \n Extensions to other interfaces \n CredentialsContainer.create() , the publicKey option \n \n Calling create() with a publicKey option initiates the creation of new asymmetric key credentials via an authenticator, as explained above. \n \n CredentialsContainer.get() , the publicKey option \n \n Calling get() with a publicKey option instructs the user agent uses an existing set of credentials to authenticate to a relying party. \n \n Examples Demo sites Usage example Note: For security reasons, the Web Authentication API calls ( create() and get() ) are canceled if the browser window loses focus while the call is pending. \n // sample arguments for registration \n const createCredentialDefaultArgs = { \n publicKey : { \n // Relying Party (a.k.a. - Service): \n rp : { \n name : \"Acme\" , \n } , \n // User: \n user : { \n id : new Uint8Array ( 16 ) , \n name : \"carina.p.anand@example.com\" , \n displayName : \"Carina P.

            "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n \n Single sign-on ( SSO ) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.\n True single sign-on allows the user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors.\n It should not be confused with same-sign on (Directory Server Authentication), often accomplished by using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and stored LDAP databases on (directory) servers. [1] [2] \n A simple version of single sign-on can be achieved over IP networks using cookies but only if the sites share a common DNS parent domain. [3] \n For clarity, a distinction is made between Directory Server Authentication (same-sign on) and single sign-on: Directory Server Authentication refers to systems requiring authentication for each application but using the same credentials from a directory server, whereas single sign-on refers to systems where a single authentication provides access to multiple applications by passing the authentication token seamlessly to configured applications.\n Conversely, single sign-off or single log-out ( SLO ) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems.\n As different applications and resources support different authentication mechanisms, single sign-on must internally store the credentials used for initial authentication and translate them to the credentials required for the different mechanisms.\n Other shared authentication schemes, such as OpenID and OpenID Connect , offer other services that may require users to make choices during a sign-on to a resource, but can be configured for single sign-on if those other services (such as user consent) are disabled. [4] An increasing number of federated social logons, like Facebook Connect , do require the user to enter consent choices upon first registration with a new resource, and so are not always single sign-on in the strictest sense.\n \n Benefits [ edit ] \n Benefits of using single sign-on include:\n \n Mitigate risk for access to 3rd-party sites (\"federated authentication\") [5] because user passwords are not stored or managed externally \n Reduce password fatigue from different username and password combinations \n Reduce time spent re-entering passwords for the same identity [5] \n Reduce IT costs due to lower number of IT help desk calls about passwords [6] \n Simpler administration. SSO-related tasks are performed transparently as part of normal maintenance, using the same tools that are used for other administrative tasks. \n Better administrative control. All network management information is stored in a single repository. This means that there is a single, authoritative listing of each user's rights and privileges. This allows the administrator to change a user's privileges and know that the results will propagate network wide. \n Improved user productivity. Users are no longer bogged down by multiple logons, nor are they required to remember multiple passwords in order to access network resources. This is also a benefit to Help desk personnel, who need to field fewer requests for forgotten passwords. \n Better network security. Eliminating multiple passwords also reduces a common source of security breaches—users writing down their passwords. Finally, because of the consolidation of network management information, the administrator can know with certainty that when he disables a user's account, the account is fully disabled. \n Consolidation of heterogeneous networks. By joining disparate networks, administrative efforts can be consolidated, ensuring that administrative best practices and corporate security policies are being consistently enforced. \n SSO shares centralized authentication servers that all other applications and systems use for authentication purposes and combines this with techniques to ensure that users do not have to actively enter their credentials more than once.\n \n Criticism [ edit ] \n The term reduced sign-on (RSO) has been used by some to reflect the fact that single sign-on is impractical in addressing the need for different levels of secure access in the enterprise, and as such more than one authentication server may be necessary. [7] \n As single sign-on provides access to many resources once the user is initially authenticated (\"keys to the castle\"), it increases the negative impact in case the credentials are available to other people and misused. Therefore, single sign-on requires an increased focus on the protection of the user credentials, and should ideally be combined with strong authentication methods like smart cards and one-time password tokens. [7] \n Single sign-on also increases dependence on highly-available authentication systems; a loss of their availability can result in denial of access to all systems unified under the SSO. SSO can be configured with session failover capabilities in order to maintain the system operation. [8] Nonetheless, the risk of system failure may make single sign-on undesirable for systems to which access must be guaranteed at all times, such as security or plant-floor systems.\n Furthermore, the use of single-sign-on techniques utilizing social networking services such as Facebook may render third party websites unusable within libraries, schools, or workplaces that block social media sites for productivity reasons. It can also cause difficulties in countries with active censorship regimes, such as China and its \" Golden Shield Project \", where the third party website may not be actively censored, but is effectively blocked if a user's social login is blocked. [9] [10] \n \n Security [ edit ] \n In March 2012, [11] a research paper reported an extensive study on the security of social login mechanisms. The authors found 8 serious logic flaws in high-profile ID providers and relying party websites, such as OpenID (including Google ID and PayPal Access), Facebook , Janrain , Freelancer , FarmVille , and Sears.com . Because the researchers informed ID providers and relying party websites prior to public announcement of the discovery of the flaws, the vulnerabilities were corrected, and there have been no security breaches reported. [12] \n In May 2014, a vulnerability named Covert Redirect was disclosed. [13] It was first reported \"Covert Redirect Vulnerability Related to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID\" by its discoverer Wang Jing, a Mathematical PhD student from Nanyang Technological University , Singapore. [14] [15] [16] In fact, almost all [ weasel words ] Single sign-on protocols are affected. Covert Redirect takes advantage of third-party clients susceptible to an XSS or Open Redirect. [17] \n In December 2020, flaws in federated authentication systems were discovered to have been utilized by attackers during the 2020 United States federal government data breach . [18] [19] \n Due to how single sign-on works, by sending a request to the logged-in website to get a SSO token and sending a request with the token to the logged-out website, the token cannot be protected with the HttpOnly cookie flag and thus can be stolen by an attacker if there is an XSS vulnerability on the logged-out website, in order to do session hijacking . Another security issue is that if the session used for SSO is stolen (which can be protected with the HttpOnly cookie flag unlike the SSO token), the attacker can access all the websites that are using the SSO system. [20] \n \n Privacy [ edit ] \n As originally implemented in Kerberos and SAML, single sign-on did not give users any choices about releasing their personal information to each new resource that the user visited. This worked well enough within a single enterprise, like MIT where Kerberos was invented, or major corporations where all of the resources were internal sites. However, as federated services like Active Directory Federation Services proliferated, the user's private information was sent out to affiliated sites not under control of the enterprise that collected the data from the user. Since privacy regulations are now tightening with legislation like the GDPR , the newer methods like OpenID Connect have started to become more attractive; for example MIT, the originator of Kerberos, now supports OpenID Connect . [21] \n \n Email address [ edit ] \n Single sign-on in theory can work without revealing identifying information such as email addresses to the relying party (credential consumer), but many credential providers do not allow users to configure what information is passed on to the credential consumer. As of 2019, Google and Facebook sign-in do not require users to share email addresses with the credential consumer. \" Sign in with Apple \" introduced in iOS 13 allows a user to request a unique relay email address each time the user signs up for a new service, thus reducing the likelihood of account linking by the credential consumer. [22] \n \n Common configurations [ edit ] \n Kerberos-based [ edit ] \n Initial sign-on prompts the user for credentials, and gets a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT). \n Additional software applications requiring authentication, such as email clients , wikis , and revision-control systems, use the ticket-granting ticket to acquire service tickets, proving the user's identity to the mail-server / wiki server / etc. without prompting the user to re-enter credentials. \n Windows environment - Windows login fetches TGT. Active Directory -aware applications fetch service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.\n Unix / Linux environment - Login via Kerberos PAM modules fetches TGT. Kerberized client applications such as Evolution , Firefox , and SVN use service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.\n \n Smart-card-based [ edit ] \n Initial sign-on prompts the user for the smart card . Additional software applications also use the smart card, without prompting the user to re-enter credentials. Smart-card-based single sign-on can either use certificates or passwords stored on the smart card.\n \n Integrated Windows Authentication [ edit ] \n Integrated Windows Authentication is a term associated with Microsoft products and refers to the SPNEGO , Kerberos , and NTLMSSP authentication protocols with respect to SSPI functionality introduced with Microsoft Windows 2000 and included with later Windows NT -based operating systems. The term is most commonly used to refer to the automatically authenticated connections between Microsoft Internet Information Services and Internet Explorer . Cross-platform Active Directory integration vendors have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to Unix (including Mac) and Linux systems.\n \n Security Assertion Markup Language [ edit ] \n Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML -based method for exchanging user security information between an SAML identity provider and a SAML service provider . SAML 2.0 supports W3C XML encryption and service-provider–initiated web browser single sign-on exchanges. [23] A user wielding a user agent (usually a web browser) is called the subject in SAML-based single sign-on. The user requests a web resource protected by a SAML service provider. The service provider, wishing to know the identity of the user, issues an authentication request to a SAML identity provider through the user agent. The identity provider is the one that provides the user credentials. The service provider trusts the user information from the identity provider to provide access to its services or resources.\n \n Emerging configurations [ edit ] \n Mobile devices as access credentials [ edit ] \n A newer variation of single-sign-on authentication has been developed using mobile devices as access credentials. Users' mobile devices can be used to automatically log them onto multiple systems, such as building-access-control systems and computer systems, through the use of authentication methods which include OpenID Connect and SAML, [24] in conjunction with an X.509 ITU-T cryptography certificate used to identify the mobile device to an access server.\n A mobile device is \"something you have\", as opposed to a password which is \"something you know\", or biometrics (fingerprint, retinal scan, facial recognition, etc.) which is \"something you are\". Security experts recommend using at least two out of these three factors ( multi-factor authentication ) for best protection.\n \n See also [ edit ] \n Account pre-hijacking \n Central Authentication Service \n Identity management \n Identity management systems \n List of single sign-on implementations \n Password manager \n Security Assertion Markup Language \n Usability of web authentication systems \n References [ edit ] \n \n ^ \"What's the Difference b/w SSO (Single Sign On) &amp; LDAP?\" .

            "text": "What is Single Sign-On? \n Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that enables users to securely authenticate with multiple applications and websites by using just one set of credentials. \n \n \n How Does SSO Work? \n SSO works based upon a trust relationship set up between an application, known as the service provider, and an identity provider, like OneLogin. This trust relationship is often based upon a certificate that is exchanged between the identity provider and the service provider. This certificate can be used to sign identity information that is being sent from the identity provider to the service provider so that the service provider knows it is coming from a trusted source. In SSO, this identity data takes the form of tokens which contain identifying bits of information about the user like a user’s email address or a username. The login flow usually looks like this: A user browses to the application or website they want access to, aka, the Service Provider. The Service Provider sends a token that contains some information about the user, like their email address, to the SSO system, aka, the Identity Provider, as part of a request to authenticate the user. The Identity Provider first checks to see whether the user has already been authenticated, in which case it will grant the user access to the Service Provider application and skip to step 5. If the user hasn’t logged in, they will be prompted to do so by providing the credentials required by the Identity Provider. This could simply be a username and password or it might include some other form of authentication like a One-Time Password (OTP) . Once the Identity Provider validates the credentials provided, it will send a token back to the Service Provider confirming a successful authentication. This token is passed through the user’s browser to the Service Provider. The token that is received by the Service Provider is validated according to the trust relationship that was set up between the Service Provider and the Identity Provider during the initial configuration. The user is granted access to the Service Provider. When the user tries to access a different website, the new website would have to have a similar trust relationship configured with the SSO solution and the authentication flow would follow the same steps. \n \n \n \n \n What is an SSO Token? \n An SSO token is a collection of data or information that is passed from one\nsystem to another during the SSO process. The data can simply be a\nuser’s email address and information about which system is sending the\ntoken. Tokens must be digitally signed for the token receiver to verify that\nthe token is coming from a trusted source. The certificate that is used for\nthis digital signature is exchanged during the initial configuration process. \n \n Is SSO Secure? \n The answer to this question is “It depends.” There are many reasons why SSO can improve security. A single sign-on solution can simplify username and password management for both users and administrators. Users no longer have to keep track of different sets of credentials and can simply remember a single more complex password. SSO often enables users to just get access to their applications much faster. SSO can also cut down on the amount of time the help desk has to spend on assisting users with lost passwords. Administrators can centrally control requirements like password complexity and multi-factor authentication (MFA) . Administrators can also more quickly relinquish login privileges across the board when a user leaves the organization. Single Sign-On does have some drawbacks. For example, you might have applications that you want to have locked down a bit more. For this reason, it would be important to choose an SSO solution that gives you the ability to, say, require an additional authentication factor before a user logs into a particular application or that prevents users from accessing certain applications unless they are connected to a secure network. \n \n How is SSO Implemented? \n The specifics on how an SSO solution is implemented will differ depending on what exact SSO solution you are working with. But no matter what the specific steps are, you need to make sure you have set clear objectives and goals for your implementation. Make sure you answer the following questions: What different types of users are you serving and what are their different requirements? Are you looking for an On Prem solution or a Cloud Based solution? Will this solution be able to grow with your company and your needs? What features are you looking for to ensure only trusted users are logging in? MFA, Adaptive Authentication, Device Trust, IP Address Whitelisting, etc.? What systems do you need to integrate with? Do you need API access? \n \n What Makes a True SSO System? \n It’s important to understand the difference between single sign-on and password vaulting or password managers, which are sometimes referred to as SSO which can mean Same Sign-on not Single Sign-on. With password vaulting, you may have the same username and password, but they need to be entered each time you move to a different application or website. The password vaulting system is simply storing your credentials for all the different applications and inserting them when necessary. There is no trust relationship set up between the applications and the password vaulting system. With SSO, meaning Single Sign-On, after you’re logged in via the SSO solution, you can access all company-approved applications and websites without having to log in again. That includes cloud applications as well as on-prem applications, often available through an SSO portal (also called a login portal). \n \n What is an SSO Software vs an SSO Solution \n When researching SSO options that are available, you might see them sometimes referred to as SSO software vs an SSO solution vs an SSO provider. In many cases, the difference might simply be in the way the companies have categorized themselves. A piece of software suggests something that is installed on-premise. It is usually designed to do a specific set of tasks and nothing else. A solution suggests that there is the ability to expand or customize the capabilities of the core product. A provider would be a way to refer to the company that is producing or hosting the solution. For example, OneLogin is known as an SSO solution provider. \n \n \n Are There Different Types of SSO? \n There are a lot of terms that are used when we talk about Single Sign-On (SSO). Federated Identity Management (FIM) OAuth (specifically OAuth 2.0 nowadays) OpenID Connect (OIDC) Security Access Markup Language (SAML) Same Sign On (SSO) SSO is actually a part of a larger concept called Federated Identity Management, thus sometimes SSO is referred to as federated SSO. FIM just refers to a trust relationship that is created between two or more domains or identity management systems. Single Sign-on is often a feature that is available within a FIM architecture. OAuth 2.0 is a specific framework that could also be considered part of a FIM architecture. OAuth focuses on that trusted relationship allowing user identity information to be shared across the domains. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication layer that was built on top of OAuth 2.0 to provide Single Sign-on functionality. Same Sign On which is also often referred to as SSO is actually not the same as Single Sign-on because it doesn’t involve any trust relationship between the entities that are doing the authentication. It is more dependent on credentials being duplicated between systems and simply passing in those credentials when necessary. It is not as secure as any of the Single Sign-on solutions. There are also some specific systems that commonly come up when we are discussing Single Sign-on: Active Directory, Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). Active Directory, which nowadays is specifically referred to as Active Directory Directory Services (ADDS), is Microsoft’s centralized directory service. Users and resources are added to the directory service for central management and ADDS works with authentication protocols like NTLM and Kerberos. Thus, users that belong to ADDS can authenticate from their machines and get access to others systems that integrate with ADDS. This is a form of Single Sign-on. Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is a type of Federated Identity Management system that also provides Single Sign-on capabilities. It supports both SAML and OIDC. ADFS is primarily used to set up trust between ADDS and other systems such as Azure AD or other ADDS forests. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is simply an industry standard that defines a way to organize and query directory information. LDAP allows you to centrally manage resources like users and systems. LDAP, however, does not define how you log into those systems, meaning it does not define the actual protocols that are used in authentication. It is, however, often used as part of the authentication process and access control processes. For example, before a user can access a particular resource, LDAP might be used to query for that user and any groups that they belong to in order to see if the user has access to that resource. LDAP solutions like OpenLDAP do provide authentication through their support of authentication protocols like Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) \n \n \n \n \n What is SSO Software as a Service? \n Just as many other applications have moved to run within the Internet, so has SSO functionality. Platforms like OneLogin that run in the cloud can then be categorized as a Software as a Service (SaaS) SSO solution. \n \n What is App-to-App SSO? \n Lastly, you might have heard of App-to-App or Application-to-Application SSO. This is not quite an industry standard yet. It is more of a term that has been used by SAPCloud to describe the process of passing a user identity from one application to another within their ecosystem. It is somewhat similar to OAuth 2.0 but again it is not a standard protocol or method and is currently specific to SAPCloud.",

It works through a trust relationship between a service provider (the application) and an identity provider (like OneLogin).  The identity provider verifies the user's credentials (often username and password, sometimes including multi-factor authentication).  If authenticated, a token containing user information is sent to the service provider, granting access.  This process repeats for each website with a similar trust relationship configured.  While SSO simplifies access and improves security by centralizing password management and enabling stronger password policies, its security depends on the implementation.\n",

            "text": "What is single sign-on (SSO)? \n Single sign-on (SSO) is a technology which combines several different application login screens into one. With SSO, a user only has to enter their login credentials (username, password, etc.) one time on a single page to access all of their SaaS applications. \n SSO is often used in a business context, when user applications are assigned and managed by an internal IT team. Remote workers who use SaaS applications also benefit from using SSO. \n Imagine if customers who had already been admitted to a bar were asked to show their identification card to prove their age each time they attempted to purchase additional alcoholic beverages. Some customers would quickly become frustrated with the continual checks and might even attempt to circumvent these measures by sneaking in their own beverages. \n However, most establishments will only check a customer's identification once, and then serve the customer several drinks over the course of an evening. This is somewhat like an SSO system: instead of establishing their identity over and over, a user establishes their identity once and can then access several different services. \n SSO is an important aspect of many identity and access management (IAM) or access control solutions. User identity verification is crucial for knowing which permissions each user should have. Cloudflare Zero Trust is one example of an access control solution that integrates with SSO solutions for managing users' identities. \n \n \n Article \n Elevating organizational trust with Zero Trust \n \n \n Guide \n The Zero Trust guide to securing aplication access \n \n \n What are the advantages of SSO? \n In addition to being much simpler and more convenient for users, SSO is widely considered to be more secure. This may seem counterintuitive: how can signing in once with one password, instead of multiple times with multiple passwords, be more secure? Proponents of SSO cite the following reasons: \n \n \n Stronger passwords: Since users only have to use one password, SSO makes it easier for them to create, remember, and use stronger passwords.* In practice, this is typically the case: most users do use stronger passwords with SSO.\n \n *What makes a password \"strong\"? A strong password is not easily guessed and is random enough that a brute force attack is not likely to succeed. w7:g\"5h$G@ is a fairly strong password; password123 is not. \n No repeated passwords: When users have to remember passwords for several different apps and services, a condition known as \"password fatigue\" is likely to set in: users will re-use passwords across services. Using the same password across several services is a huge security risk because it means that all services are only as secure as the service with the weakest password protection: if that service's password database is compromised, attackers can use the password to hack all of the user's other services as well. SSO eliminates this scenario by reducing all logins down to one login. \n Better password policy enforcement: With one place for password entry, SSO provides a way for IT teams to easily enforce password security rules. For example, some companies require users to reset their passwords periodically. With SSO, password resets are easier to implement: instead of constant password resets across a number of different apps and services, users only have one password to reset. (While the value of regular password resets has been called into question , some IT teams still consider them an important part of their security strategy.) \n Multi-factor authentication: Multi-factor authentication , or MFA, refers to the use of more than one identity factor to authenticate a user . For example, in addition to entering a username and password, a user might have to connect a USB device or enter a code that appears on their smartphone. Possession of this physical object is a second \"factor\" that establishes the user is who they say they are. MFA is much more secure than relying on a password alone. SSO makes it possible to activate MFA at a single point instead of having to activate it for three, four, or several dozen apps, which may not be feasible. \n Single point for enforcing password re-entry: Administrators can enforce re-entering credentials after a certain amount of time to make sure that the same user is still active on the signed-in device. With SSO, they have a central place from which to do this for all internal apps, instead of having to enforce it across multiple different apps, which some apps may not support. \n Internal credential management instead of external storage: Usually, user passwords are stored remotely in an unmanaged fashion by applications and services that may or may not follow best security practices. With SSO, however, they are stored internally in an environment that an IT team has more control over. \n Less time wasted on password recovery: In addition to the above security benefits, SSO also cuts down on wasted time for internal teams. IT has to spend less time on helping users recover or reset their passwords for dozens of apps, and users spend less time signing into various apps to perform their jobs. This has the potential to increase business productivity. \n \n How does an SSO login work? \n Whenever a user signs in to an SSO service, the service creates an authentication token that remembers that the user is verified. An authentication token is a piece of digital information stored either in the user's browser or within the SSO service's servers, like a temporary ID card issued to the user. Any app the user accesses will check with the SSO service. The SSO service passes the user's authentication token to the app and the user is allowed in. If, however, the user has not yet signed in, they will be prompted to do so through the SSO service. \n An SSO service does not necessarily remember who a user is, since it does not store user identities. Most SSO services work by checking user credentials against a separate identity management service. \n Think of SSO as a go-between that can confirm whether a user's login credentials match with their identity in the database, without managing the database themselves — somewhat like when a librarian looks up a book on someone else's behalf based on the title of the book. The librarian does not have the entire library card catalog memorized, but they can access it easily. \n How do SSO authentication tokens work? \n The ability to pass an authentication token to external apps and services is crucial in the SSO process. This is what enables identity verification to take place separately from other cloud services, making SSO possible. \n Think of an exclusive event that only a few people are allowed into. One way to indicate that the guards at the entrance to the event have checked and approved a guest is to stamp each guest's hand. Event staff can check the stamps of every guest to make sure they are allowed to be there. However, not just any stamp will do; event staff will know the exact shape and color of the stamp used by the guards at the entrance. \n Just as each stamp has to look the same, authentication tokens have their own communication standards to ensure that they are correct and legitimate. The main authentication token standard is called SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) . Similar to how webpages are written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), authentication tokens are written in SAML. \n How does SSO fit into an access management strategy? \n SSO is only one aspect of managing user access. It must be combined with access control, permission control, activity logs, and other measures for tracking and controlling user behavior within an organization's internal systems. SSO is a crucial element of access management, however. If a system does not know who a user is, there is no way to allow or restrict that user's actions. \n Does Cloudflare integrate with SSO solutions? \n Cloudflare Zero Trust controls and secures user access to applications and websites; it can act as a replacement for most VPNs . Cloudflare integrates with SSO providers in order to identify users and enforce their assigned access permissions.",

            "text": "What is single sign-on (SSO)? \n Single sign-on (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials -- for example, a username and password -- to access multiple applications. SSO is used by organizations of all sizes and individuals to ease the management of multiple credentials. \n \n \n Single sign-on enables users to authenticate with multiple apps without needing to remember each password.\n \n \n \n \n How does single sign-on work? \n Single sign-on is a federated identity management arrangement. The use of such a system is sometimes called identity federation . Open Authorization ( OAuth ) is the framework that enables an end user's account information to be used by third-party services, such as Facebook, without exposing the user's password. \n OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the end user by providing the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared. When a user attempts to access an application from the service provider, the service provider sends a request to the identity provider for authentication . The service provider then verifies the authentication and logs the user in. \n In a basic web SSO service, an agent module on the application server retrieves the specific authentication credentials for an individual user from a dedicated SSO policy server, while authenticating the user against a user repository, such as a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol directory. The service authenticates the end user for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates future password prompts for individual applications during the same session. \n \n \n Types of SSO configurations \n Some SSO services use protocols, such as Kerberos or Security Assertion Markup Language ( SAML ): \n \n In a Kerberos-based setup, once user credentials are provided, a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) is issued. The TGT fetches service tickets for other applications the user wants to access, without asking the user to reenter credentials. \n SAML is an Extensible Markup Language standard that facilitates the exchange of user authentication and authorization data across secure domains. SAML-based SSO services involve communications among the user, an identity provider that maintains a user directory and a service provider. \n Smart card -based SSO asks an end user to use a card holding the sign-in credentials for the first login. Once the card is used, the user does not have to reenter usernames or passwords. SSO smart cards store either certificates or passwords. \n \n \n \n Social SSO \n Google, LinkedIn, Apple, Twitter and Facebook offer popular SSO services that enable end users to log in to third-party applications with their social media authentication credentials. \n Many security professionals recommend end users refrain from using social SSO services because, once attackers gain control of a user's SSO credentials, they can access all other applications that use the same credentials. \n \n \n Enterprise SSO \n Enterprise single sign-on (eSSO) software and services are password managers with client and server components that log a user on to target applications by replaying user credentials. These credentials are almost always a username and password. Target applications do not need to be modified to work with the eSSO system. \n \n \n SSO security risks \n Although single sign-on is a convenience to users, it presents risks to enterprise security. An attacker who gains control over a user's SSO credentials is granted access to every application the user has rights to, increasing the amount of potential damage. \n To avoid malicious access, SSO should be coupled with identity governance. Organizations can also use two-factor authentication ( 2FA ) or multifactor authentication with SSO to improve security. \n \n \n SSO advantages and disadvantages \n Advantages of SSO include the following: \n \n Users need to remember and manage fewer passwords and usernames for each application. \n The process of authenticating with applications is streamlined -- no need to reenter passwords. \n Successful phishing attacks are reduced. \n IT help desks see fewer complaints or tickets regarding passwords. \n \n Disadvantages of SSO include the following: \n \n It does not address certain levels of security each application sign-on might need. \n If availability is lost to apps that only allow SSO, users become locked out. \n If unauthorized users gain access, they could access more than one application. \n \n \n \n SSO vendors \n Multiple vendors offer SSO products, services and features. SSO vendors include the following: \n \n Rippling enables users to sign in to cloud applications from multiple devices. \n Avatier Identity Anywhere is SSO for Docker container-based platforms. \n OneLogin by One Identity is a cloud-based identity and access management platform that supports SSO. \n Okta is an enterprise tool with SSO functionality. \n \n Editor's note: This article was written by Taina Teravainen in 2020.

            "text": "Skip to main content \n \n This browser is no longer supported. \n Upgrade to Microsoft Edge to take advantage of the latest features, security updates, and technical support. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What is single sign-on in Microsoft Entra ID? \n Article 10/30/2023 \n \n \n \n In this article \n This article provides you with information about the single sign-on (SSO) options that are available to you. It also outlines an introduction to planning a single sign-on deployment when using Microsoft Entra ID. Single sign-on is an authentication method that allows users to sign in using one set of credentials to multiple independent software systems. Using SSO means a user doesn't have to sign in to every application they use. With SSO, users can access all needed applications without being required to authenticate using different credentials. For a brief introduction, see Microsoft Entra single sign-on . \n Many applications already exist in Microsoft Entra ID that you can use with SSO. You have several options for SSO depending on the needs of the application and how it's implemented. Take time to plan your SSO deployment before you create applications in Microsoft Entra ID. The management of applications can be made easier by using the My Apps portal. \n Single sign-on options \n Choosing an SSO method depends on how the application is configured for authentication. Cloud applications can use federation-based options, such as OpenID Connect, OAuth, and SAML. The application can also use password-based SSO, linked-based SSO, or SSO can be disabled. \n \n Federation - When you set up SSO to work between multiple identity providers, it's called federation. An SSO implementation based on federation protocols improves security, reliability, end-user experiences, and implementation. \n With federated single sign-on, Microsoft Entra authenticates the user to the application by using their Microsoft Entra account. This method is supported for SAML 2.0 , WS-Federation, or OpenID Connect applications. Federated SSO is the richest mode of SSO. Use federated SSO with Microsoft Entra ID when an application supports it, instead of password-based SSO and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). \n There are some scenarios where the SSO option isn't present for an enterprise application. If the application was registered using App registrations in the portal, then the single sign-on capability is configured to use OpenID Connect and OAuth by default. In this case, the single sign-on option doesn't appear in the navigation under enterprise applications. \n Single sign-on isn't available when an application is hosted in another tenant. Single sign-on is also not available if your account doesn't have the required permissions (Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal). Permissions can also cause a scenario where you can open single sign-on but might not be able to save. \n \n \n Password - On-premises applications can use a password-based method for SSO. This choice works when applications are configured for Application Proxy. \n With password-based SSO, users sign in to the application with a username and password the first time they access it. After the first sign-on, Microsoft Entra ID provides the username and password to the application. Password-based SSO enables secure application password storage and replay using a web browser extension or mobile app. This option uses the existing sign-in process provided by the application, enables an administrator to manage the passwords, and doesn't require the user to know the password. For more information, see Add password-based single sign-on to an application . \n \n Linked - Linked sign-on can provide a consistent user experience while you migrate applications over a period of time. If you're migrating applications to Microsoft Entra ID, you can use linked-based SSO to quickly publish links to all the applications you intend to migrate. Users can find all the links in the My Apps or Microsoft 365 portals. \n After a user has authenticated with a linked application, an account needs to be created before the user is provided single sign-on access. Provisioning this account can either occur automatically, or it can occur manually by an administrator. You can't apply Conditional Access policies or multifactor authentication to a linked application because a linked application doesn't provide single sign-on capabilities through Microsoft Entra ID. When you configure a linked application, you're simply adding a link that appears for launching the application. For more information, see Add linked single sign-on to an application . \n \n Disabled - When SSO is disabled, it isn't available for the application. When single sign-on is disabled, users might need to authenticate twice. First, users authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID, and then they sign in to the application. \n Disable SSO when: \n \n You're not ready to integrate this application with Microsoft Entra single sign-on \n \n You're testing other aspects of the application \n \n An on-premises application doesn't require users to authenticate, but you want them to. With SSO disabled, the user needs to authenticate. \n If you configured the application for SP-initiated SAML-based SSO and you change the SSO mode to disabled, it doesn't stop users from signing in to the application outside the MyApps portal. To stop users from signing in from outside My apps portal, you need to disable the ability for users to sign in. \n \n \n \n \n Plan SSO deployment \n Web applications are hosted by various companies and made available as a service. Some popular examples of web applications include Microsoft 365, GitHub, and Salesforce. There are thousands of others. People access web applications using a web browser on their computer. Single sign-on makes it possible for people to navigate between the various web applications without having to sign in multiple times. For more information, see Plan a single sign-on deployment . \n How you implement SSO depends on where the application is hosted. Hosting matters because of the way network traffic is routed to access the application. Users don't need to use the Internet to access on-premises applications (hosted on a local network). If the application is hosted in the cloud, users need the Internet to use it. Cloud hosted applications are also called Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. \n For cloud applications, federation protocols are used. You can also use single sign-on for on-premises applications. You can use Application Proxy to configure access for your on-premises application.

            "text": "Single Sign-on (SSO) occurs when a user logs in to one application and is then signed in to other applications automatically, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain the user is using. The user signs in only one time, hence the name of the feature (Single Sign-on). For example, if you log in to a Google service such as Gmail, you are automatically authenticated to YouTube, AdSense, Google Analytics, and other Google apps. Likewise, if you log out of your Gmail or other Google apps, you are automatically logged out of all the apps; this is known as Single Logout. SSO provides a seamless experience for users when using your applications and services. Instead of having to remember separate sets of credentials for each application or service, users can simply log in once and access your full suite of applications. Whenever users go to a domain that requires authentication, they are redirected to the authentication domain where they may be asked to log in. If the user is already logged in at the authentication domain, they can be immediately redirected to the original domain without signing in again. How it works Single Sign-on and Single Logout are possible through the use of sessions . There may be up to three different sessions for a user with SSO: Local session maintained by the application Authorization Server session, if SSO is enabled Identity Provider (IdP) session, if the user chose to log in through an Identity Provider (such as Google, Facebook, or an enterprise SAML Identity Provider) With SSO, a central domain performs authentication and then shares the session with other domains. The way a session is shared may differ between SSO protocols, but the general concept is the same. For example, the authentication domain may generate a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) (encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE)), which contains all the information needed to identify the user for any other domain requiring authentication. This token is passed to the client, but because it is signed, it cannot be modified in any way by the client. The token can be passed to the original domain by a redirect and used by the authentication domain and any other domains to identify the user. SSO with Universal Login The easiest and most secure way to implement Single Sign-on (SSO) with Auth0 is by using Universal Login for authentication. In fact, currently SSO is only possible with native platforms (like iOS or Android) if the application uses Universal Login . The Swift and Android quick starts provide some examples of using Universal Login. If you cannot use Universal Login with your application, review the following for additional info on embedded authentication: Lock Auth0.js SSO on first login For SSO with Auth0, the Central Service is the Auth0 Authorization Server . Let's look at an example of the SSO flow when a user logs in for the first time: Your application redirects the user to the login page. Auth0 checks to see whether there is an existing SSO cookie. Because this is the first time the user is visiting the login page and no SSO cookie is present, the user will be asked to log in using one of the connections you have configured. Once the user has logged in, Auth0 will set an SSO cookie and redirect the user to your application, returning an ID Token that contains identity information for the user. SSO on subsequent logins Let's look at an example of the SSO flow when a user returns to your website for a subsequent visit: Your application redirects the user to the login page. Auth0 checks to see whether there is an existing SSO cookie. Auth0 finds the SSO cookie, and if necessary, updates it. No login screen is shown. Auth0 redirects the user to your application, returning an ID Token that contains identity information for the user. Check user's SSO status You can check a user's SSO status from an application by calling the checkSession method of the auth0.js SDK, which will attempt to silently authenticate the user within an iframe. Whether the authentication is successful or not indicates whether the user has an active SSO cookie. Protocols SAML and WS-Federation Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and Web Services Federation ( WS-Fed ) are both protocols that are widely used in SSO implementations. Both SAML and WS-Fed exchange authorization and authentication data in XML format; the main parts of this exchange are the user, the identity provider, and the service provider. With SAML or WS-Fed: A user requests a resource from the service provider. The service provider checks with the identity provider to see if the user should have access to the resource. The identity provider verifies the user's identity, and if valid, asserts back to the service provider that the user should have access. OpenID Connect OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol commonly used in consumer-facing SSO implementations. The OIDC protocol handles authentication through JSON Web Tokens and a central identity provider. With OIDC: A user requests access to an application. The application redirects the user to the identity provider for authentication. The identity provider verifies the user, and if successful, prompts the user to grant data access to the application. If access is granted, the identity provider generates an ID Token, which contains user identity information that the application can consume. The identity provider returns the user to the application. AD/LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an application protocol used to access a directory of credentials that can be shared by multiple applications; it is commonly used by intranets. When paired with Active Directory (AD), LDAP provides a centralized location for user identity, so the application makes an authentication request to the LDAP/AD server. The LDAP protocol exchanges information in LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF). Service-provider-initiated SSO For Service-Provider-initiated SSO , Auth0 is the SSO Service Provider (SP). When a user logs in to an application: The application presents the user with one or more external identity providers. The user selects an identity provider to authenticate with and logs in. Upon successful authentication, the user is returned to the application. SP-initiated SSO in Auth0 is handled by connections. Identity-provider-initiated SSO For Identity-Provider-initiated SSO , a third-party Identity Provider (IdP) is the SSO provider. When a user logs in to an application: The application redirects the user to an identity provider. The third-party identity provider performs authentication and authorization. Upon successful authentication, the user is returned to the application. When planning an IdP-initiated SSO implementation, you may choose to use Auth0's SSO Dashboard Extension , which allows you to create a dashboard that lists multiple enterprise applications that can be enabled for SSO. This dashboard is then presented to your users to log in. Use cases Business to Business For Business to Business (B2B) scenarios, SSO can simplify packaging your application for enterprise consumption. With Auth0, your applications can support common enterprise federation scenarios, such as Active Directory (AD), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Ping, or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). This allows your partners and enterprise customers to log in with their preferred enterprise identity technologies. Case Study: O'Reilly Business to Consumer CIAM For Business to Consumer (B2C) or Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) scenarios, SSO can provide frictionless access to your applications or services. You can let customers authenticate through popular social identity providers, such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, X, and Microsoft, instead of requiring them to make another account.

            "text": "There are several identity and access management solutions you can choose from, depending on your requirements. \n Federated identity management \n Federated identity management (FIM) is a digital framework that allows multiple applications from different vendors to share, manage, and authenticate user identity. For example, FIM allows your workforce to login to one application and then access several other enterprise applications without logging in again. FIM authenticates the credential submitted from the service provider with a credible identity provider. \n SSO vs. federated identity management \n Federated identity management is a comprehensive identity authentication and management solution for cross-domain applications. Meanwhile, single sign-on (SSO) is a specific functionality within the FIM model. While FIM allows users to access services from different vendors with a single login, SSO is limited to services or applications hosted by a single vendor. \n Same sign-on \n Same sign-on, which also bears the SSO acronym, is a digital solution that stores and synchronizes user credentials on devices accessed by the user. It is similar to password vaults or password managers that allow users to sign in to multiple apps on different devices without remembering the credentials. \n Single sign-on vs. same sign-on \n Single sign-on systems require a one-time authentication from the user. Once logged in, the user can access other web applications and services without re-authenticating themselves. Meanwhile, same sign-on requires the user to repeat the login process each time with the same authentication credentials. \n Multi-factor authentication \n Multi-factor authentication is a user authentication framework using two or more technologies to verify the user’s identity. For example, users enter their email address and password on a webpage and key in a one-time password (OTP) sent to their mobile phone to enable secure access. \n SSO vs. multi-factor authentication \n SSO enables organizations to simplify and strengthen password security by allowing access to all connected services with a single login. Multi-factor authentication provides additional security layers to reduce the possibility of unauthorized access through stolen credentials. Both SSO and multi-factor authentication can be integrated to improve the security posture of web applications.",

It differs from same sign-on, which requires repeated logins with the same credentials.  Unlike FIM, which spans multiple vendors, SSO typically applies to applications from a single vendor.  SSO improves security by simplifying password management but can be further enhanced by integrating multi-factor authentication.\n",

            "text": "Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to log into multiple services and applications using the same credentials. Specifically, Autodesk allows users to seamlessly log into multiple Autodesk products and services using their organization's user credentials. \n Why use SSO ? \n Enhanced user experience - Users only need to sign in once, and need not remember multiple passwords. This saves time because they are less likely to need a password reset. \n \n Enhanced security - SSO uses a single point of authentication, where passwords are received and validated only by the identity provider. This approach reduces the possibility of poor security practices such as writing down the passwords, as users are required to remember only a single password. \n \n Streamlined administration - Admins only need to maintain one email/password combo for each user, and password policies applied to the network are also applied to Autodesk services. So if you revoke an employee’s email access, they will also lose access to Autodesk. Therefore, it is not necessary to revoke access to each services individually. \n \n \n Scope Autodesk SSO uses the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 protocol. We have currently tested and support the following Identity Providers (IdP): \n \n Microsoft Azure \n Okta \n Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) \n OneLogin \n PingOne \n PingFederate \n Google Cloud Identity \n Shibboleth \n \n Capabilities \n Authentication - Autodesk's SSO solution supports federated authentication. You sign in to Autodesk services using your company credentials instead of using an Autodesk ID and password. Additionally, Autodesk supports syncing groups and users from your company directory via our directory sync capabilities. Please refer to the directory sync section of the help guide for more information. \n Support for Single User Subscription, Multi User Subscription and Token Flex licensing and Cloud Connectivity for 2017 product versions and later. \n SSO is enforced across all products and services - Autodesk Single Sign on is implemented via email domain, not by product, project, or end point, meaning once SSO is enabled user is required to use their company credentials to access Autodesk services. There is no hybrid solution using old Autodesk ID + SSO for the same email domain. \n \n Known Issues \n Depending on the current patch level of your deployed software, product updates may be required to implement SSO on all Autodesk products. Please comprehensively test your products and key workflows to ensure user access is as expected.",
